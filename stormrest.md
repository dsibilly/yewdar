# Stormrest

Divest is something of a mining boom town. By the luck of the surveyor's eye, the State ended up with a large adamantite ore deposit of the same type as those found in the nearby Amphine Plateau, beneath the mountainous reaches that belonged to the dwarves. The various corporations of the State wasted no time sending work crews up the Entrev river valley to investigate and start building out what later became Divest. Now its a town of 600, with its own corporate council and worker delegate.

Towering over Divest to the south is the great grey peak of Stormrest Mountain. It got its name from the way great wet thunderstorms rising from the jungles far southward would seem to break upon its ridge for hours at times. Watching Stormrest's lightshow at night quickly became a bit of a pastime among the miners, their families and management. 

About six months ago, in the Spring of Broken Age 35, a new crew arrived in Divest. These newcomers were not miners. They were not geologists.

They were Towerwright union builders. They were Underminer quarry sappers. SteedFast's bricklayers. House Worthen artificers. They arrived with a mandate from the First Minister: build a tower in cooperation with dwarven consultants atop Stormrest. After the crews came the cargo boats upriver. Then the airships hauling stone and wood. Two months later they started laying stone for a lightning rail track. Mining proceeded uninterrupted, but the "locals" were both curious and suspicious of their new colleagues. Week by week, a grey silhouette began to take shape atop the mountain. It looked like a finger beckoning skyward.

When the storms would come, the artificers usually knew well in advance and helped the crews clear out back down the trails to Divest. They'd watch alongside the miners as the lightning played along Stormsrest, ocassionally making corruscating flashes around the paling they'd erected to protect their work. And no matter the hour, day or night, as soon as the storms ceased the crew would return to the trails and back to their craft.

Some noticed that the storms started to come more frequently after a while. They would rise up to the peak and seem to focus their fury upon the ever-growing tower, like the heavens themselves sought to tear it down.

It endured. It grew. And then just a few days ago, a new storm arrived.

The mountain work crew were not seen on the trails. No one came back down at all.

And the storm is still there.

A storm rests upon Stormrest, and in the most brilliant and intense of the lightning some of the miners swear they see the silhouette of the tower within. Still growing larger, reaching ever skyward.
