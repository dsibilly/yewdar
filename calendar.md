# Marking the Passage of Time

Yewdar has no globally consistent way of marking the passage of time. Various kith and countries have their own method. Likewise, there are various holidays, feasts, and celebrations.

## Kulturian Calendar

A Kulturian year has 388 days, separated into 12 months of 32 days each with 4 intercalary feast days marking the end/beginning of seasons. Weeks are 8 days long, with four weeks per month for nice regular months. Yewdar's moon, Taupra, has a 25-day cycle wherein the phases precess ahead in the week by one day every cycle.

The four solstice and equinox festivals are celebrated universally, although names and customs differ from people to people and region to region.

## Holidays

Some notable examples of holidays are the following: 
- Liberation Day, on 28 Highsun, is the Laurentian day of independence from Kulturia.
- The Div' observe Gracetide on the first day of every year (1 Frostfall) in observance of Vor, goddess of Mercy, whose compassion ensured their existence in the world when the other gods would have discarded them.
- The Church of Dynu, god of valor, has a number of observances on their annual liturgical calendar that follow the Tale of Timun, alter-ego of their deity. Timun's is a parable of how bravery can only exist in times of fear and doubt, and the dangers of false, boastful pride.
- The 22nd of Blossomtide is the annual observance of the Day of Broken Scales, when dragons disappeared from the world. The drakon peoples spend their day in prayer and vigil, waiting for their creators to return while celebrations are held across Kulturia. As one might imagine, this is a point of cultural tension for drakon in Kulturia. The dragons were politically enemies of the Osan rebels until their disappearance; while the Osan see the day as an unmitigated salvation, the drakon see it as a cataclysmic event for their people.
