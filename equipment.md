## Resources

An optional mechanic, borrowed from Modern AGE, is to replace characters' cash with a single Resources score. This score is a composite that represents a character's cash on hand, income, financial connections. The Resources score works like the nine ability scores in that it is the basis for Resources tests made when a character attempts to purchase goods or services.

### Starting Resources

A character's starting Resources score is based in part on their background. Over the course of play, a character's Resources score may decrease as a result of large expenditures or increase as they gain power and notoriety. A character's Resources score can never fall below -2, and it is unlimited as to how high it can become.

Since Resources is an abstraction of wealth and material belongings, determining exactly how well-off a character is can be challenging. The Resources Score table provides a rough guide to what kind of lifestyle a given Resources score implies.

| Resources Score | Financial Condition |
| :-------------: | :-----------------: |
| -2 to +0 | Serfdom |
| +1 to +2 | Freeholder |
| +3 to +5 | Tradesman |
| +6 to +8 | Artisan |
| +9 to +10 | Merchant |
| +11 to +13 | Aristocrat |
| +14 or higher | Royalty |

### The Resources Test

With the Resources score, determining whether you can afford a specific item or service becomes a test similar to those made against your ability scores: a 3d6 roll plus your Resources score. If your test result meets or exceeds the item's Resources target number, you successfully purchase it. If you fail, you cannot afford it at this time from this particular venue.

#### Automatic Success

If your Resources score + 4 is equal to or greater than the item's Resources TN, you automatically succeed. The cost of the item is trivial to one with your wealth. For example, a character with Resources +5 can purchase items up to Resources TN 9 without a test. The GM may set resonable limits on this, however; it is not intended to represent the ability to buy an infinite number of low-cost items!

#### Resource Depletion

If you successfully purchase something with a Resources TN greater than your Resources score + 10, your Resources score decreases by 1. This represents the significant depletion of your available Resources in order to acquire this valuable item or service. Note that your Resources score only decreases if you *succeed* at purchasing the item. Resource depletion never occurs when you fail a Resources test.

#### Purchasing and Time

Purchasing items with a Resources TN of 13 or higher may take additional time as the GM sees fit. This extra time represents the difficulty finding an available item of such value, and the negotiations involved in closing the transaction.

#### Try Again?

You can retry a failed Resources test, but you must spend a number of hours equal to the Resources TN of the item looking for another purchase opportunity. Your failure represents a lost opportunity at this specific time and with this specific seller; you need to spend time to line up another deal.

#### Material Support

One character may assist another with their purchase, but only if the assisting character's Resource score is equal to or greater than that of the purchasing character. The assisting character provides the purchaser with a +2 bonus on their Resources test to buy that item. If the item's Resource TN is above the assisting character's Resources score + 10, the assisting character depletes their Resources by 1 to represent the impact of such an expenditure.

### Gaining Resources

The GM may grant an increase to Resources at the end of an adventure where the characters acquired wealth. This is usually a +1 increase in a Resources score, though truly significant gains may be represented by a +2 increase.


### Selling Items

Characters will eventually want to sell a valuable item. Determine the item's value, which is equal to it's Resources TN - 1. If the item's value is greater than the seller's Resources, selling the item grants a +1 increase in Resources. If the item's value is 6 or more greater than the seller's Resources, selling the item grants a +2 increase.

Illegal (or stolen) goods come with their own trouble, and are subsequently less valuable when attempting to sell them. Selling a stolen or illegal item reduces its value by 1, and the GM may require a Communication (Bargaining) test for the seller to avoid the notice of authoritities. Failure means the sale falls through, and there may be legal consequences for the seller!

The GM should handle acquisition and sale of valuables acquired from adventures with a Resources award rather than managing the value and sale of individual items. This minimizes bookkeeping and streamlines gameplay.

## Weapons

### Weapon Training

Weapons are classified into weapon groups. Having a weapon group implies that your character has received special training in the use of the weapons within that group. You typically receive weapon groups through your class at Level 1, though you can also be granted a weapon group by your choice of kith or via certain talents or specializations.

If you are untrained in a weapon group, you take a -2 penalty to attack rolls and inflict half damage, rounded down, when using a weapon from that group. If you attempt to use a ranged weapon from a weapon group you do not have, the range for that weapon is halved as well. When halving damage, add your Strength (or Perception for Bows and Blaster weapons) before dividing the total by 2.

### Weapon Details

The following tables summarize the game statistics for Yewdar-specific weapons. They are separated by weapon group, and the governing ability for that group is noted in parentheses. The first entry, for example, is the Blaster Pistols Group (Accuracy). When you attack with a weapon from this group, your attack roll is an Accuracy (Blaster Pistols) test.

The following details are provided for each weapon:

- **Damage**: This is the weapon's base damage in combat. If you are trained in this weapon group, you inflict this amount of damage plus your Strength. If you are untrained, damage is halved (rounded down.)
- **Minimum Strength**: Some weapons are heavy or unwieldy, and so require a certain amount of Strength to use effectively. You must have the minimum Strength listed to use the weapon to its full potential. If you do not, the weapon only deals 1d6-1 damage.
- **Resources Target Number**: The TN used when attempting to use the Resources ability to acquire equipment. This difficulty may vary depending on the game's location, setting, or a character's circumstances.

#### Blaster Pistols (Accuracy)

|        Weapon        | Damage | Min. Str. | Resources TN |
|:---------------------|:------:|:---------:|:------------:|
| Holdout Pistol       | 1d6    | -1        | 10           |
| Light Blaster Pistol | 1d6+2  | 0         | 12           |
| Heavy Blaster Pistol | 2d6    | 0         | 13           |

**Holdout Blaster Pistol**: A small, easily concealable blaster pistol, often kept in an ankle holster or in the small of the back for use in desperate situations. Requires one hand to use, and a single shot expends 1 charge from an arcanathyst battery.

**Light Blaster Pistol**: The most common type of blaster pistol. Requires one hand to use and a single shot expends 1 arcanathyst battery charge.

**Heavy Blaster Pistol**: A large and obvious weapon. Requires one hand to use and expends 1 charge from an arcanathyst battery.

#### Blaster Longarms (Accuracy)

| Weapon | Damage | Min. Str. | Resources TN |
|:------|:------:|:---------:|:----:|
| Blaster Sweeper | 2d6 | 0 | 13 |
| Blaster Carbine | 2d6+2 | 0 | 13 |
| Blaster Rifle | 3d6 | 1 | 14 |

**Blaster Sweeper**: A short-barreled weapon that fires a wide beam of energy a short distance, potentially damaging several targets. The blast is 6 yards long and 2 yards wide. Make a single attack roll when firing a blaster sweeper and compare it to the Defense of each target in the blast area. Stunts affect targets individually. A Mighty Blow, for example, would apply to _one_ target of your choice, not all targets in the blast. You cannot use Lightning Attack with a blaster sweeper, but you can Dual Strike. This weapon requires two hands to use and a single shot consumes 3 charges from an arcanathyst battery.

**Blaster Carbine**: A light rifle that requires two hands to use. A single shot expends 1 arcanathyst battery charge.

**Blaster Rifle**: A military weapon that fires a powerful blast of energy. It requires two hands to use and a single shot burns up 5 arcanathyst battery charges.

#### Curved Blades (Accuracy)

| Weapon | Damage | Min. Str. | Resources TN |
|:------|:------:|:---------:|:----:|
| Cutlass | 1d6+2 | - | 13 |
| Falchion\* | 2d6+2 | 2 | 14 |
| Scimitar | 2d6 | 0 | 13 |

**Cutlass**: A short, curved single-edged sword used for slashing and thrusting. Favored by pirates.

**Falchion**: A heavy, broad-bladed and curved single-edged sword that delivers devastating chops.

**Scimitar**: A smaller version of the falchion that is more easily wielded one-handed.

#### Flails (Fighting)

| Weapon | Damage | Min. Str. | Resources TN |
|:------|:------:|:---------:|:----:|
| Flail | 2d6 | 1 | 13 |
| Scourge | 1d6 | - | 12 |
| Two-handed Flail | 2d6+2 | 2 | 14 |

**Flail**: A short haft of wood or metal with up to a foot-long length of chain extending from the tip, ending in a spiked metal ball. The chain converts the momentum of swings into brutal impacts.

**Scourge**: A short whip, sometimes tipped with barbs.

**Two-Handed Flail**: A larger, heftier variant of flail. The haft can be as long as 5 feet. The head is often heavier, and the chain shorter. Typically used by infantry to unseat mounted cavalry.

#### Rope (Accuracy)

| Weapon | Damage | Min. Str. | Cost |
|:------|:------:|:---------:|:----:|
| Garrote | Special | - | 8 |
| Lasso | Special | - | 7 |
| Whip | 1d6-1 | - | 8 |

**Garrote**: A short length of thing wire with wooden handles on either end. On a successful attack, the target cannot move and begins to be strangled. The target must use a Major action to make a TN 15 Constitution (Stamina) test to hold their breath, or break free with an opposed Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Might) vs. the attacker's Accuracy (Rope). If the victim fails, they suffer 1d6-1 penetrating damage.

**Lasso**: A length of rope with a loop at the end tied with a know that quickly constricts the loop when pulled. Often used to wrangle animals. On a successful attack, the target must make an opposed Strength (Might) test to move. The attacker may use a subsequent Major action to pull the target toward them by 2 yards with an opposed Strength (Might) test. Undoing a lasso intact takes a full turn.

**Whip**: A whip is often made of intertwined strands of supple, tanned leather. You can attack targets from 2 yards away with a whip.

## New Gear

### Arcanathyst Batteries
Arcanathyst's ability to store magical energy for long periods of time and for later reuse has spurred a revolution in technology on Yewdar. Arcanathyst batteries can be charged by any magic-user. The charging process requires a TN 13 casting roll (no arcana focuses apply.) On a success, the caster may spend 2 magic points to restore one charge to the battery.

**Arc-LY**: A common low-yield arcanathyst battery that is available all over Yewdar. It holds a maximum of 10 charges.

**Arc-MY**: A medium-yield battery made from a more pure and refined form of arcanathyst. It holds a maximum of 20 charges.

**Arc-HY**: Made from only the purest arcanathyst, HY batteries take inordinate amounts of magical processing and resources to create. Due to demand on pure arcanathyst in other industries, batteries made from this material are rarely available for sale and are very expensive when found. It holds a maximum of 50 charges.

#### Arcanathyst Batteries

| Gear |Charges| Resources TN |
|:----:|:-----:|:------------:|
|Arc-LY|  10   | 14 |
|Arc-MY|  20   | 18 |
|Arc-HY|  50   | 22 |

## Poisons

Yewdar is home to a variety of substances (both natural and processed) that create deleterious effects for those that come into contact with them.

**Crow's Wort**: Inflicts 1d6 penetrating damage against non-construct targets at the beginning of the target's next turn. Target may succeed at a TN 11 Constitution (Stamina) test to resist this damage.

**Deathroot Extract**: Target must succeed at a TN 11 Willpower (Self-Discipline) test or experience hallucinations for 1d6 rounds. While hallucinating the target suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and defense. Every round while hallucinating the target may attempt a TN 13 Willpower (Self-Discipline) test to dispel the hallucinations.

**Harrow Dust**: Target suffers a -2 penalty to Strength tests for 1d6 rounds. TN 13 Constitution (Stamina) test to resist.

**Spider's Kiss**: Target is stunned for 1 round and may only take Minor actions on their turn.

## Wondrous Items

### Arcanathyst Cake (Consumable)

![](/assets/arcanathyst_cake.jpg)

**Use**: Eating a slice of arcanathyst cake grants the consumer 1d6 MP, regardless of class. Non-spellcaster classes receive these magic points as temporary magic points that last until the venue changes or the end of the current encounter; they may spent these MP as stunt points on any tests they make while they persist.

**Side-effect**: Eating more than one slice of arcanathyst cake per day puts the consumer at risk of addiction. For each slice after the first, the consumer must succeed at a TN 13 Willpower (Self-Discipline) test or become mildly addicted. If addicted, the consumer must consume at least one slice daily for 1d6 days or suffer a -2 penalty to all tests. Sating the addiction immediately removes the penalty. They may attempt a TN 15 Willpower (Self-Discipline) or Constitution (Stamina) test daily to dispel the addiction and its negative side-effect.

> “*The latest culinary innovation from Shurros, the arcanathyst cake is a rare treat. So light and fluffy it almost floats off the plate, it serves as a distinguished dessert for a more refined palate. This delicacy comes with a hefty price tag, but everyone this foodie has spoken to says it’s well worth it. I got to try this decadent cake last night at a benefit in Apex City, and it lifted my spirits in a way that will surely leave me wanting more in the days to come.*” -**Killian Erman**, food critic
