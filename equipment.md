\*Requires two hands.

**Cutlass**: A short, curved single-edged sword used for slashing and thrusting. Favored by pirates.

**Falchion**: A heavy, broad-bladed and curved single-edged sword that delivers devastating chops.

**Flail**: A short haft of wood or metal with up to a foot-long length of chain extending from the tip, ending in a spiked metal ball. The chain converts the momentum of swings into brutal impacts.

**Garrote**: A short length of thing wire with wooden handles on either end. On a successful attack, the target cannot move and begins to be strangled. The target must use a Major action to make a TN 15 Constitution (Stamina) test to hold their breath, or break free with an opposed Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Might) vs. the attacker's Accuracy (Rope). If the victim fails, they suffer 1d6-1 penetrating damage.

**Heavy Blaster Pistol**: A large and obvious weapon. Requires one hand to use and expends 1 charge from an arcanathyst crystal.

**Holdout Blaster Pistol**: A small, easily concealable blaster pistol, often kept in an ankle holster or in the small of the back for use in desperate situations. Requires one hand to use, and a single shot expends 1 charge from an arcanathyst battery.

**Lasso**: A length of rope with a loop at the end tied with a know that quickly constricts the loop when pulled. Often used to wrangle animals. On a successful attack, the target must make an opposed Strength (Might) test to move. The attacker may use a subsequent Major action to pull the target toward them by 2 yards with an opposed Strength (Might) test. Undoing a lasso intact takes a full turn.

**Light Blaster Pistol**: The most common type of blaster pistol. Requires one hand to use and a single shot expends 1 arcanathyst battery charge.

**Scimitar**: A smaller version of the falchion that is more easily wielded one-handed.

**Scourge**: A short whip, sometimes tipped with barbs.

**Two-Handed Flail**: A larger, heftier variant of flail. The haft can be as long as 5 feet. The head is often heavier, and the chain shorter. Typically used by infantry to unseat mounted cavalry.

**Whip**: A whip is often made of intertwined strands of supple, tanned leather. You can attack targets from 2 yards away with a whip.

### Arcanathyst Batteries
Arcanathyst's ability to store magical energy for long periods of time and for later reuse has spurred a revolution in technology on Yewdar. Arcanathyst batteries can be charged by any magic-user. The charging process requires a TN 13 casting roll (no arcana focuses apply.) On a success, the caster may spend 2 magic points to restore one charge to the battery.

## Arcanathyst Batteries

|  Gear  |  Cost  |
|--------|--------|
| Arc-LY | 10 sp  |
| Arc-MY | 25 sp  |
| Arc-HY | 100 sp |

**Arc-LY**: A common low-yield arcanathyst battery that is available all over Yewdar. It holds a maximum of 10 charges.

**Arc-MY**: A medium-yield battery made from a more pure and refined form of arcanathyst. It holds a maximum of 20 charges.

**Arc-HY**: Made from only the purest arcanathyst, HY batteries take inordinate amounts of magical processing and resources to create. Due to demand on pure arcanathyst in other industries, batteries made from this material are rarely available for sale and are *very* expensive when found. It holds a maximum of 50 charges.
