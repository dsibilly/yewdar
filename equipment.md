## Equipment

| Holdout Pistol | 1d6 | - | 30 sp |
|Light Blaster Pistol|1d6+2|-|50 sp|
|Heavy Blaster Pistol|2d6|0|75 sp|

**Holdout Blaster Pistol**: A small, easily concealable blaster pistol, often kept in an ankle holster or in the small of the back for use in desperate situations. Requires one hand to use, and a single shot expends 1 charge from an arcanathyst battery.

**Light Blaster Pistol**: The most common type of blaster pistol. Requires one hand to use and a single shot expends 1 arcanathyst battery charge.

**Heavy Blaster Pistol**: A large and obvious weapon. Requires one hand to use and expends 1 charge from an arcanathyst battery.

|Blaster Rifle    |3d6   | 1 |75 sp  |

**Blaster Sweeoer**: A short-barreled weapon that fires a wide beam of energy a short distance, potentially damaging several targets. The blast is 6 yards long and 2 yards wide. Make a single attack roll when firing a blaster sweeper and compare it to the Defense of each target in the blast area. Stunts affect targets individually. A Mighty Blow, for example, would apply to _one_ target of your choice, not all targets in the blast. You cannot use Lightning Attack with a blaster sweeper, but you can Dual Strike. This weapon requires two hands to use and a single shot consumes 3 charges from an arcanathyst battery.

**Blaster Carbine**: A light rifle that requires two hands to use. A single shot expends 1 arcanathyst battery charge.

**Blaster Rifle**: A military weapon that fires a powerful blast of energy. It requires two hands to use and a single shot burns up 5 arcanathyst battery charges.

**Cutlass**: A short, curved single-edged sword used for slashing and thrusting. Favored by pirates.

**Falchion**: A heavy, broad-bladed and curved single-edged sword that delivers devastating chops.

**Scimitar**: A smaller version of the falchion that is more easily wielded one-handed.



##### Flails (Fighting)

|:------|:------:|:---------:|:----:|
| Flail | 2d6 | 1 | 16 sp |
|Scourge|1d6|-|11 sp|
|Two-handed Flail|2d6+2|2|20 sp|

**Flail**: A short haft of wood or metal with up to a foot-long length of chain extending from the tip, ending in a spiked metal ball. The chain converts the momentum of swings into brutal impacts.

**Scourge**: A short whip, sometimes tipped with barbs.

**Two-Handed Flail**: A larger, heftier variant of flail. The haft can be as long as 5 feet. The head is often heavier, and the chain shorter. Typically used by infantry to unseat mounted cavalry.

| Garrote | Special | - | 8 sp |
|Lasso|Special|-|5 sp|
|Whip|1d6-1|-|10 sp|

**Garrote**: A short length of thing wire with wooden handles on either end. On a successful attack, the target cannot move and begins to be strangled. The target must use a Major action to make a TN 15 Constitution (Stamina) test to hold their breath, or break free with an opposed Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Might) vs. the attacker's Accuracy (Rope). If the victim fails, they suffer 1d6-1 penetrating damage.

**Lasso**: A length of rope with a loop at the end tied with a know that quickly constricts the loop when pulled. Often used to wrangle animals. On a successful attack, the target must make an opposed Strength (Might) test to move. The attacker may use a subsequent Major action to pull the target toward them by 2 yards with an opposed Strength (Might) test. Undoing a lasso intact takes a full turn.

**Whip**: A whip is often made of intertwined strands of supple, tanned leather. You can attack targets from 2 yards away with a whip.

### New Gear

#### Arcanathyst Batteries
Arcanathyst's ability to store magical energy for long periods of time and for later reuse has spurred a revolution in technology on Yewdar. Arcanathyst batteries can be charged by any magic-user. The charging process requires a TN 13 casting roll (no arcana focuses apply.) On a success, the caster may spend 2 magic points to restore one charge to the battery.

**Arc-LY**: A common low-yield arcanathyst battery that is available all over Yewdar. It holds a maximum of 10 charges.

**Arc-MY**: A medium-yield battery made from a more pure and refined form of arcanathyst. It holds a maximum of 20 charges.

**Arc-HY**: Made from only the purest arcanathyst, HY batteries take inordinate amounts of magical processing and resources to create. Due to demand on pure arcanathyst in other industries, batteries made from this material are rarely available for sale and are very expensive when found. It holds a maximum of 50 charges.

##### Arcanathyst Batteries
| Gear |Charges| Cost |
|:----:|:-----:|:-----|
|Arc-LY|  10   |10 sp |
|Arc-MY|  20   |25 sp |
|Arc-HY|  50   |100 sp|

### Poisons

Yewdar is home to a variety of substances (both natural and processed) that create deleterious effects for those that come into contact with them.

**Crow's Wort**: Inflicts 1d6 penetrating damage against non-construct targets at the beginning of the target's next turn. Target may succeed at a TN 11 Constitution (Stamina) test to resist this damage.

**Deathroot Extract**: Target must succeed at a TN 11 Willpower (Self-Discipline) test or experience hallucinations for 1d6 rounds. While hallucinating the target suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and defense. Every round while hallucinating the target may attempt a TN 13 Willpower (Self-Discipline) test to dispel the hallucinations.

**Harrow Dust**: Target suffers a -2 penalty to Strength tests for 1d6 rounds. TN 13 Constitution (Stamina) test to resist.

**Spider's Kiss**: Target is stunned for 1 round and may only take Minor actions on their turn.

### Wondrous Items

#### Arcanathyst Cake (Consumable)

![](/assets/arcanathyst_cake.jpg)

**Use**: Eating a slice of arcanathyst cake grants the consumer 1d6 MP, regardless of class. Non-spellcaster classes receive these magic points as temporary magic points that last until the venue changes or the end of the current encounter; they may spent these MP as stunt points on any tests they make while they persist.

**Side-effect**: Eating more than one slice of arcanathyst cake per day puts the consumer at risk of addiction. For each slice after the first, the consumer must succeed at a TN 13 Willpower (Self-Discipline) test or become mildly addicted. If addicted, the consumer must consume at least one slice daily for 1d6 days or suffer a -2 penalty to all tests. Sating the addiction immediately removes the penalty. They may attempt a TN 15 Willpower (Self-Discipline) or Constitution (Stamina) test daily to dispel the addiction and its negative side-effect.

> “*The latest culinary innovation from Shurros, the arcanathyst cake is a rare treat. So light and fluffy it almost floats off the plate, it serves as a distinguished dessert for a more refined palate. This delicacy comes with a hefty price tag, but everyone this foodie has spoken to says it’s well worth it. I got to try this decadent cake last night at a benefit in Apex City, and it lifted my spirits in a way that will surely leave me wanting more in the days to come.*” -**Killian Erman**, food critic
