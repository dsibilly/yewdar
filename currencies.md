## Currency

Each nation-state has its own currency. The table below lists the nation-state and its largest denomination. Note that the orcs of Hol Khozet do not mint coins. Their economy functions via trade of non-perishable foodstuffs and territory.

| Nation | Coin | Approx. Value |
|:-------|:-----|:-------------:|
| Kulturia   | Krona     |     |
| Laurentia  | Sovereign |     |
| Grendia    | Triad     |     |
| Cheland    | Blossom   |     |
| Aqor       | Bikel     |     |
| Hol Khozet | N/A       | N/A |
| *Nari’el*  | Manat     |     |
| *Cthene*   | Talon     |     |

### Krona

The Krona is a round, oblong coin minted in gold with a thick rim of iron around the edge to prevent easy shaving.

### Triad

The Triad is a triangular disk of adamantite, silver, or brass. Each coin is designed to be split into three diamond-shaped pieces worth one third of the total value and three of next lowest denomination. The dwarves LOVE threes.

### Sovereign

The Sovereign is of similar design to the Krona, but pentagonal instead of round.

### Blossom

The Chelanese Blossom is a round, lobed coin about 1 cm wide and with a hole in the center. They resemble their namesake, and are meant to be carried on a knotted string or necklace.

### Bikel

The Aqori Bikel is a familiar circular coin. The center of the coin is glass, with precious metal around the rim. The visage of the reigning Imperator at the time of minting is etched onto the glass.

### Manat

The fallen elven nation of Nari’el used the Manat as their currency. They are planks of oiled woods with thin bars of precious metals inlayed into mortised patterns. They are exceptionally rare, highly sought by collectors, and universally worth more now than face value.

### Talon

The Talon of Cthene is not a reliable unit of currency. The long-lost dragons of the Empire did not concern themselves with mortal concepts of value other than to hoard it. A Talon was literally a mass of coins and such equivalent to the weight of an adult dragon’s largest talon.
