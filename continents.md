In addition to these continents, there are also other [planes of existence](planes.md), and a vast subterranean area.

## What Lies Beneath

The subterranean interior of Yewdar is a dark, dangerous place. Exotic flora and fauna inhabit the echoing fissures & caverns in the deep places.

Of the surface folk, only the dwarves have extensive experience with underground living, and while they will share knowledge of raising subsurface livestock or agriculture, they do not often speak of the native dangers of the deeps with outsidersâ€¦

## Geological Changes

Geography has been pretty static since the Sublime Age, given that the entirety of recorded history since fits into a few millennia. There are signs of many natural disasters:
* An asteroid impact created the Bay of Gur in Chimak
* The rich soil of Hol Khozet and the Reisian islands in Osenia are the result of sediment deposits from tsunami impacts.
* Whatever happened in Cthene on the Day of Broken Scales, natural or not, is clearly on the scale of a disaster as well.

## Osenia

By far the largest continent, Osenia is located in the eastern hemisphere of the planet. Its most prominent feature is the mountain range that divides the continent.

## Chimak

Located in the western hemisphere and mostly in the southern half of the planet, Chimak is the second largest continent on Yewdar. It has a variety of climes but is best known for its dense forest, forbidding mountain ranges, and the large Bay of Gur, an oceanic impact crater named for the goddess of war. The Alsan peoples, one of the three branches of humanity, is native to Chimak, as are the Qandaha minotaurs and the Div'.

Politically the continent is unified under the Aqori Imperium, a theocratic state that is the oldest extant government on Yewdar. Chimak is surrounded by many small islands and cays and is joined to the southeast by the island of Aqor, where the Alsan clans that founded the Imperium keep their ancestral home and the Imperial capital of Sharain.

## Ikaemo

Ikaemo is the smallest of Yewdar's continents and includes the majority of the northern polar ice cap. It contains the troll nation of Mok'tar, as well as the ruins of the fallen elvish nation Nari'el.
