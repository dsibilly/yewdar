# Elf

The Elves originally hail from a coplanar realm known as The Verdance, or Primal Wilds \(Eladari’el in Elvish.\) It is a wild and untamed replica of Yewdar that is at once separate from and connected to it. In the dim mists of antiquity, a population of proto-elves fled to Yewdar to escape a devastating civil war in Eladari’el. As they spent more time away from their home realm, they lost much of their attunement to the innate natural magic of the world. Their culture turned to the arcane forces they found in their new home, and their incredible longevity allowed them to attain a mastery unmatched by the other races. Today’s elves live relatively short lives compared to their forebears, but it is not uncommon for an elf to see the turn of three centuries before they fade away.

Just over one elf generation ago, a great elven empire spanned the subcontinentt of Ikaemo. The empire fell to an invasion of trolls whose durability and fecundity literally bred the elves out of their homeland. The survivors took to the sea on their elegant ships, staying close for mutual defense, looking for a new home. The last three centuries have seen the Eladar Fleet criss-crossing the seas of Yewdar at the command of the Prophetess Lalahni, whose vision of the next homeland Danari’el promises eventual rest and restoration of her people’s glory.
