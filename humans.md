# Human

Humans are the most numerous of the sentient species on Yewdar. They are relatively short-lived, with lifetimes over a century being exceedingly rare. Their fast lives make them a striving people. Unable to bide their brief time, they work hard and are always preoccupied with the immediate future. The older races see them as short-sighted and impulsive, but there is no denying the success that their drive has earned. Human kingdoms and enterprises are among the most culturally and economically dominant on the planet.

Humanity contains three major ethnic groups: the _Alsan_, _Osan_, and _Irsan _peoples.

If you choose to play a human, modify your character as follows:

## Alsan

The Alsan peoples originally hail from the Aqor Imperium on the Chimak contintent far to the west of Osenia. They "discovered" Osenia in antiquity, though it was already populated by Osan clans. Being relatively advanced compared to the native Osan, they quickly established a vast colony on Osenia to exploit the continent's lush natural resources. This vassal state later came to be known as the Nevrodt Empire, which the Osan eventuallly overthrew when they founded modern-day Kulturia. In the 1,200 years since the fall of Nevrodt, the remaining Alsan humans have integrated thoroughly into Kulturian society. They are a dark brown skinned people with dark, straight hair, stout-framed with broad faces.

## Osan

The indigenous humans of the Osenia continent, the Osan peoples were originally hardy folk accustomed to the extremes of their land. Centuries of subjugation by the Nevrodt Empire and forced "civilization" at the hands of their conquerors advanced their society considerably, and by the time they overthrew their would-be masters the Osan were inheritors of industry and magic that were heretofore the exclusive realm of their clan priests. They are proud of their history as a people who threw off the yoke of oppression, and they value strength of body and mind. The Osan are now the most populous ethnicity of human on Osenia, with their home kingdom Kulturia remaining the largest and most powerful in the region. They are fair-skinned, with light-colored wavy hair. They tend to be tall, with women averaging 1.7 meters and heights of 2 meters not uncommon among males.
