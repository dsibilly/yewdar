# The Gods of Yewdar

Twelve deities watch over Yewdar and its inhabitants. Anyone can venerate one of them, and many lay people worship the Twelve in a general sense as part of an ecumenical faith. Others hold one or a few deities as their personal or household patrons. For example, a craftsman is likely to have a shrine to Ka in their workshop, and an army barracks might have a symbol of Dynu on the entrance's lintel.

## Patronage by Kith

The ten "deifacted" kith have a patron deity, though their relationship with them varies. Notice that the gods of life and death are patrons of no specific people. Their spheres encompass all.

Abasys refrains from being patron of any specific peoples because she insists her reign over death and souls demands that she be impartial.

Enakoh doesn't have his own people because he is so enamored with *making* life that he never slows down to actually *care* for it.

| Deity    | Sphere    | Kith     |
|:---------|:----------|:---------|
| Dynu     | Valor     | Human    |
| Ka       | Strength  | Dwarf    |
| Vor      | Mercy     | Div'     |
| N'er     | Time      | Qandaha  |
| Enakoh   | Life      |          |
| Abasys   | Death     |          |
| Meno     | Knowledge | Halfling |
| Jashus   | Dreams    | Elf      |
| Mym      | Luck      | Gnome    |
| Gur      | War       | Orc      |
| Perak    | Pain      | Turahl   |
| Illirael | Trickery  | Gnome    |

The Talosan and Drakon peoples are "mortifacted" kith: created by mortal beings entire, with no direct hand from the Twelve. As such, they have no patron diety, but individuals may worship (or not worship) as they see fit, the same as any other kith.

## Dynu
_The Ever-Brave, Master of Fear, Timun, The Great Bull, The Fearless Falcon_

**Symbol**: A charging silver-horned bull

**Portfolio**: Valor, bravery, righteous combat

**Appearance**: A strapping bare-chested human male, often astride a bull with silver horns, holding a falcon on one arm and a spear in the other hand. His alter-ego, Timun, takes many forms, usually a scrawny and timid stereotype of any mortal race.

**Favored Arcana**: Heroic, Lightning, Protection

Dynu is a proud god, friendly but firm to his fellow deities and any mortals he encounters. He is filled with a need to inspire others to greatness; his own deeds and accomplishments are worthless if they do not move the mortals who witness them or hear of them to daring deeds of their own. He has a deep understanding of fear and anxiety, and despite being named the Fearless Falcon by his clergy, he is well-versed in being afraid. Dynu knows that the only way to *be* brave is to act *in spite* of fear, not in the absence of it. He has periodically appeared in the form of his alter-ego, Timun, who is the personification of anxiety and fearfulness. As Timun, he works to show mortals time and again that fear is never eliminated, but overcome.

Dynu wields the great spear *Sigmobos, the Sum of All Fears*. His bull is named *Phalorn*, and his falcon *Gerux*. His dragon is *Ynrrow the Fearless*, father of the valordrakes.

## Ka
_The Maker, Carver of Stone, Hands of Diamond, Mother of Metals_

**Symbol**: A diamond cradled in a pair of hands

**Portfolio**: Raw strength, craft, competition

**Favored Arcana**: Earth, Enchantment, Power

**Appearance**: A swarthy dwarven female with deep brown hair in intricate braids, wearing a roughly finished set of crude plate armor.

Ka is gruff, direct, and has no patience for pretense or finery. She finds value in strength and ability, and wants to hone that quality in others. While she may lack tolerance for social niceties, she *is* divinely patient and will wait for millennia for a plan she set in motion to come to fruition. As such, she has a special place in her heart for the builders and crafters of the world, those who use their strength and skill to make greater things of rude raw materials. She is a competitive deity, and loves all manner of sport and contest, especially those that involve brute strength or endurance.

Ka wields *Asman*, a greathammer hewn from stone with a head of oblong unfinished diamond that she crushed out of coal with her own hands. Her companion is *Xelun*, a brown bear with emeralds for eyes. Her dragon is *Kasalt*, progenitor of the obsidian wyrms.

## Vor
_The Merciful, Lady of Light, Highmatron_

**Symbol**: A winged golden circle

**Portfolio**: Healing, compassion, the moon

**Appearance**: A stately woman of indeterminate race with an ephemeral pair of wings emanating from her back.

**Favored Arcana**: Healing, Psychic, Water

Vor is a goddess of healing and of compassion. Her daughter, the demigoddess *Anja*, founded a devout monastic order that seeks to spread goodwill and end the suffering of all peoples. Vor rarely makes personal appearances, preferring to act through Anja or her monks. She avoids battle, but when pressed prefers the open hand to any crafted weapon.

Vor's companion is *Vorun* the Lunar Wyrm, ancestor of the phase drakes.

## N'er
_Keeper of the Allsaga, Chronicler, He Who Walks All Paths_

**Symbol**: A black book on an inverted silver triangle

**Portfolio**: Time, prophecy, history

**Appearance**: When appearing in humanoid form, N'er takes the shape of a child of a random race carrying a book bound with soft leather.

**Favored Arcana**: Divination, Fate, Power

N'er is an eternal child, which is a jarring juxtaposition with his eon-spanning vision. He is the chronicler of the gods, recording all events in the journal Allsaga. Some followers of N'er maintain that the deity *is* the Allsaga, and any other manifestations are merely expressions of the Allsaga's desire to witness all events in all timelines.

## Enakoh
_Enkindler, Life-Binder, Breath of Life_

**Symbol**: A green flame

**Portfolio**: Living things, fertility, the sun

**Appearance**: An old elven man clad in green, with a long flowing brown beard.

**Favored Arcana**: Beast, Healing, Wood

Enakoh is the progenitor of life. He has a hand in making all mortal lifeforms, save for the drakon and talosan. He is ever-virile and intensely creative, but he is a poor caretaker. He finds joy in the act of creation, but not in tending to his creations. He leaves the care of nature and living things to his priests. Many of his followers are healers, doctors, apothecaries and the like. Some are dedicated to the wilder side of nature, tending to the untamed wilds and the creatures that dwell there. The Circle of the Dawn have power over beast and bough, and see to the wilds in ways only those initiated to its mysteries and cycles can.

## Abasys
_Matron of Souls, Deathwarden, Keeper of the Endless Halls_

**Symbol**: A gnarled scythe in a white doorway

**Portfolio**: Death, the afterlife, souls, identity

**Appearance**: A young elven woman in a black, hooded robe. Her eyes are empty sockets.

**Favored Arcana** Death, Cold, Fire

Abasys is goddess of death, of the afterlife and children. She is the ruler of the Endless Halls, where the souls of the deceased arrive when mortals perish. While death is her domain, she is no grim reaper. Abasys is an impartial judge of the dead, seeking only to ensure every living being comes to its timely end. She abhors the undead, seeing necromancy as a perversion of her domain. She has a special regard for children, particularly orphans. Many orphanages are funded at least in part by her clergy, and many of her followers were once orphans themselves.

## Meno
*Goddess of Knowledge*

**Favored Arcana** Divination, Power, Psychic

Meno is goddess of knowledge. She is a diligent researcher and keeper of secrets. Her realm is the Infinite Library, a grand hall of learning that spans its own plane while also intersecting with Yewdar in a number of hidden locations. Meno does not have traditional temples. Instead, her chapels are found in libraries and schools around the world. Her clergy are found among devout researchers, sages, and teachers. Her dogma teaches her followers to always be learning, and to increase understanding of the world. In addition to knowledge for its own sake, Meno is goddess of wine and memory, law and silence.

## Jashus
*God of Dreams, the Slumberer*

**Favored Arcana** Air, Psychic, Shadow

Jashus the Slumberer, god of dreams, explores the endless possibilities of thought and imagination wihtin his home plane of Vakaré. All mortal minds go to Vakaré when they sleep, whether they are dreaming or not, and the plane is known colloquially as the Dream Realm. While mortals are but nightly visitors to the Dream Realm, there are also native lifeforms there that form a bizarre ecosystem based on the psychic energy of dreamers. It is possible, though extremely rare, to physically enter Vakaré. Most of the native fauna take great exception to physical visitors, so those who do attempt to pass over would be well-advised to make adequate preparations! Jashus himself spends most of his existence in a dream of his own. It is said that the few times in history that he has been roused from his slumber have been moments of great and terrible change for Yewdar.

## Mym
*Goddess of Luck*

**Favored Arcana** Fate, Healing, Illusion

Mym is Lady Luck, goddess of good fortune... and ill fortune as well. She is caprice personified, and her favor bestows serendipity as her disdain brings disaster. Her very presence bends the laws of probability to make very unlikely events... likely to occur. Her followers lead charmed lives that defy odds. Her clergy are found among daredevils, gamblers, explorers and thieves.

## Gur
*Goddess of War*

**Favored Arcana** Heroic, Lightning, Water

![](/assets/pantheon/Gur.jpg)

## Perak
*God of Pain*

**Favored Arcana** Cold, Death, Shadow

Perak is the god of pain and suffering. He delights in both inflicting and experiencing pain; he is both sadism and masochism incarnate. His followers tend to choose one path or the other. The Hunters of Pain, knowns as the Scmeryogr, actively seek out suffering. Some do this for their own satisfaction. Others retain some measure of stoic compassion and seek to endure pain on behalf of those who cannot or do not want to. The flip-side of the faithful are the Inflictors, called the Cadenghabe. These sadistic schemers glorify their patron by causing anguish however and whenever possible.

![](/assets/pantheon/Perak.jpg)

## Illirael
*God of Trickery*

**Favored Arcana** Fate, Healing, Illusion

Illirael, Father of Lies, ever duplicitous, is the god of trickery. He is a master deceiver and illusionist. His worshipers invoke his name to bless a vast variety of acts, from thievery and scam to acting and business negotiations. Illirael himself is not exactly *mean-spirited* or malicious (though many of his followers *are*.) Rather, he delights in guile and crafty deception.
