## Dynu

The Ever-Brave, Master of Fear, Timun, The Great Bull, The Fearless Falcon.

**Symbol**: A charging silver-horned bull

**Portfolio**: Valor & bravery, righteous combat

**Favored Arcana: **

**Appearance**: A strapping bare-chested human male, often astride a bull with silver horns, holding a falcon on one arm and a spear in the other hand. His alter-ego, Timun, takes many forms, usually a scrawny and timid stereotype of any mortal race.

Dynu is a proud god, friendly but firm to his fellow deities and any mortals he encounters. He is filled with a need to inspire others to greatness; his own deeds and accomplishments are worthless if they do not move the mortals who witness them or hear of them to daring deeds of their own. He has a deep understanding of fear and anxiety, and despite being named the Fearless Falcon by his clergy, he is well-versed in being afraid. Dynu knows that the only way to _be_ brave is to act _in spite_ of fear, not in the absence of it. He has periodically appeared in the form of his alter-ego, Timun, who is the personification of anxiety and fearfulness. As Timun, he works to show mortals time and again that fear is never eliminated, but overcome.

Dynu wields the great spear Sigmobos, the Sum of All Fears. His bull is named Phalorn, and his falcon Gerux. His dragon is Ynrrow the Fearless, father of the valordrakes.

## Ka

The Maker, Carver of Stone, Hands of Diamond, Mother of Metals

**Symbol**: A diamond cradled in a pair of hands

**Portfolio**: Raw strength, craft, competition

**Appearance**: A swarthy dwarven female with deep brown hair in intricate braids, wearing a roughly finished set of crude plate armor.

Ka is gruff, direct, and has no patience for pretense or finery. She finds value in strength and ability, and wants to hone that quality in others. While she may lack tolerance for social niceties, she _is_ divinely patient and will wait for millennia for a plan she set in motion to come to fruition. As such, she has a special place in her heart for the builders and crafters of the world, those who use their strength and skill to make greater things of rude raw materials. She is a competitive deity, and loves all manner of sport and contest, especially those that involve brute strength or endurance.

Ka wields Asman, a greathammer hewn from stone with a head of oblong unfinished diamond that she crushed out of coal with her own hands. Her companion is Xelun, a brown bear with emeralds for eyes.

## Vor

The Merciful, Lady of Light, Highmatron

**Symbol**: A winged golden circle

**Portfolio**: Mercy, healing, compassion

**Appearance**: A stately woman of indeterminate race with an ephemeral pair of wings emanating from her back.

Vor is a goddess of healing and of compassion. Her daughter, the demigoddess Anja, founded a devout monastic order that seeks to spread goodwill and end the suffering of all peoples. Vor rarely makes personal appearances, preferring to act through Anja or her monks. She avoids battle, but when pressed prefers the open hand to any crafted weapon.

Vor's companion is Vorun the Lunar Wyrm, ancestor of the phase drakes.

## N'er

Keeper of the Allsaga, Chronicler, He Who Walks All Paths

**Symbol**: A black book on an inverted silver triangle

**Portfolio**: Time, prophecy, history

**Appearance**: When appearing in humanoid form, N'er takes the shape of a child of a random race carrying a book bound with soft leather.

N'er is an eternal child, which is a jarring juxtaposition with his eon-spanning vision. He is the chronicler of the gods, recording all events in the journal Allsaga. Some followers of N'er maintain that the deity _is_ the Allsaga, and any other manifestations are merely expressions of the Allsaga's desire to witness all events in all timelines.
