# Classes

In addition to the three basic classes detailed in the *Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook*, Yewdar introduces three new classes that add options and flavor for players as they decide how they wish to adventure in this world.

Expanding up on the concept of multi-classing found in other RPG systems, Yewdar adds a trio of hybrid classes that blend the concepts of the three core classes: the bard, the swashbuckler, and the Templar. Rules are included to provide for playing these hybrid classes to level 20, as well as three specializations for each class that reflect more specific character concepts and abilities.

## Bard

Music is magical, figuratively and literally. What separates the bard from a common minstrel is the ability to weave literal magic from song, forming spells no less powerful than any mage. Their natural charm bolsters allies and can turn unwitting adversaries to their side... at least for a time.

**Primary Abilities**: Accuracy, Communication, Dexterity, Intelligence

**Secondary Abilities**: Constitution, Fighting, Perception, Strength, Willpower

**Starting Health**: 20 + Constitution + 1d6

**Weapon Groups**: Blasters\*, Bows, Brawling, Light Blades, Staves

#### Level 1
**Bard Song**: You are able to work magic through your music. With an Activate action, you may choose one song that you've learned to perform and enter Bard Song. While your Bard Song is active, you gain the benefits of the song and you are treated as having an arcade device for the purposes of casting spells. Ending Bard Song is a free action.

**Bard Song: *Song of Valor***: While *Song of Valor* is active, allies within 12 yards of you that can both see and hear you gain a +1 bonus on attack roll.

**Class Cross-Training**: For the purpose of taking talents, you are both a Mage and a Rogue.

**Magic Training, Bard**: You weave the arcane forces of the world with your music. You may choose two magic talents from the limited list of Bard Arcana. You also use Communication (instead of Willpower) for calculating Spellpower, regaining MP, and determining spell effects. Bards are free to choose new magic talents (or advance a degree in an existing one) at any level that grants the New Talent perk.

**Magic Points, Bard**: You start with a number of magic points equal to 5 + Communication + 1d6. You spend magic points to cast spells, and regain them through rest and meditation.

You gain more magic points as you rise in level. From levels 2 through 10, you gain 3 + Communication + 1d6 magic points whenever you level. From levels 11 to 20, you gain only your Communication in MP, because increasing your power reserves at higher levels is not easy.
