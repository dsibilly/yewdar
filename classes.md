# Classes

Yewdar introduces three new classes that add options and flavor for players as they decide how they wish to adventure in this world. Expanding up on the concept of multi-classing found in other RPG systems, Yewdar adds a trio of hybrid classes that blend the concepts of the three core classes: the Bard, the Swashbuckler, and the Templar. Rules are included to provide for playing these hybrid classes to level 20. [Specializations for each new class are also available](/focuses-talents-specializations.md#specializations) to help reflect more specific character concepts and abilities.

Yewdar is also home to the three basic classes detailed in the *Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook*, but with minor modifications.

## Bard

Music is magical, figuratively and literally. What separates the bard from a common minstrel is the ability to weave literal magic into song, forming spells no less powerful than a mage's. Their natural charm bolsters allies and can turn unwitting adversaries to their side... at least for a time.

**Primary Abilities**: Accuracy, Communication, Dexterity, Intelligence

**Secondary Abilities**: Constitution, Fighting, Perception, Strength, Willpower

**Starting Health**: 20 + Constitution + 1d6

**Weapon Groups**: Blaster Pistols, Bows, Brawling, Light Blades, Staves

**Class Cross-Training**: For the purpose of taking talents, you are both a Mage and a Rogue.

**Secondary Abilities**: Accuracy, Communication, Dexterity, Perception, Strength.

**Starting Health**: 25 + Constitution + 1d6
