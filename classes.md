# Classes

Yewdar introduces three new classes that add options and flavor for players as they decide how they wish to adventure in this world. Expanding up on the concept of multi-classing found in other RPG systems, Yewdar adds a trio of hybrid classes that blend the concepts of the three core classes: the Bard, the Swashbuckler, and the Templar. Rules are included to provide for playing these hybrid classes to level 20, as well as three specializations for each class that reflect more specific character concepts and abilities.

Yewdar is also home to the three basic classes detailed in the *Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook*, but with minor modifications.

## Bard

Music is magical, figuratively and literally. What separates the bard from a common minstrel is the ability to weave literal magic into song, forming spells no less powerful than a mage's. Their natural charm bolsters allies and can turn unwitting adversaries to their side... at least for a time.

**Primary Abilities**: Accuracy, Communication, Dexterity, Intelligence

**Secondary Abilities**: Constitution, Fighting, Perception, Strength, Willpower

**Starting Health**: 20 + Constitution + 1d6

**Weapon Groups**: Blaster Pistols, Bows, Brawling, Light Blades, Staves

**Class Cross-Training**: For the purpose of taking talents, you are both a Mage and a Rogue.

(The GM is the ultimate arbiter of this talent.)

**Master**: You may call upon the heroes of old with a new Bard Song: *Song of Heroes Returned*. Once per day while Bard Song is active, make a Communication (Performance) test for each unconscious ally within 10 yards. The target number is 17.

Select a number of allies equal to your Communication that are within 12 yards and can both see and hear you. While Bard Song is active, the affected allies gain a +2 bonus on Willpower (Courage) and Willpower (Morale) tests, and a +1 bonus to damage rolls in melee combat. However, they suffer a -1 penalty to Defense and Perception-based tests. Additionally, you ignore up to 4 Strain while casting spells in armor.

<a name="swashbuckler"></a>
## Swashbuckler

The warrior wades into battle in heavy armor. The rogue catches their prey unawares. You, the swashbuckler, wield your agility and cunning as both weapon and best defense. You flourish your blade with style and speed, and eventually learn a number of tricks that enable you to deliver devastating blows. You eschew the protection of armor, preferring to make combat a dangerous game of high risk and high reward.

**Primary Abilities**: Accuracy, Communication, Constitution, Dexterity

**Secondary Abilities**: Fighting, Intelligence, Perception, Strength, Willpower

**Starting Health**: 30 + Constitution + 1d6

### Swashbuckler Specializations

#### Blade

Your blade is an extension of your self, and combined you are a finely honed weapon of grace and skill. You are an expert duelist, adept at using your opponents relatively ungainly movements against them. Your speed and misdirection exposes your opponents weaknesses and evades their clumsy tricks.

**Requirements**: Communication 2+, either Accuracy (Curved Blades) or Accuracy (Dueling).

**Novice**: Your quick movements can throw your opponent off-balance, leaving them vulnerable to your attacks. You add your Communication on damage rolls with weapons from the Dueling or Curved Blade groups (select one). You also can perform the Taunt stunt for 1 SP instead of the usual 2.

**Journeyman**: You and your weapon are never parted. You cannot be disarmed; stunt points spent trying to part you from your weapon are wasted.

**Master**: You easily relieve opponents of their weapons. You can perform the Disarm stunt for 1 SP instead of the usual 2.

#### Dervish

Through practice and ritual you have attained deep insight into the art of battle... and it is indeed an art to you. Every fight is a performance, and you are a virtuoso in motion. While the song of spell and steel rings out, you are never still. You dart through the fray like a tumbling force of nature, and your foes struggle to keep up.

**Requirements**: Dexterity 2+, Dexterity (Acrobatics) focus.

**Novice**: Nothing gets in your way. If you fail a Dexterity (Acrobatics) test, you can re-roll it. You must keep the results of the second roll.

**Journeyman**: You somersault back to your feet even after being knocked down. You can attempt a TN 17 Dexterity (Acrobatics) test after any effect that would normally knock you prone, such as the Knock Prone stunt. If you succeed, you remain standing.

**Master**: You dash in and out of danger in the blink of an eye. You may move up to your total speed when you use the Charge action, instead of the usual half speed. Also, you may make the attack portion of the Charge action *at any point during your movement*; after the attack, you may continue to move, but at half your speed.

#### Scoundrel

You've lived by the sword long enough to know that it's only a matter of time before someone brings a bigger sword. Luckily, you have your trusty arcane blaster. It has limited ammo, sure, but what it gives you is *options*... like keeping this street thug's friends behind cover down the alleyway while you relieve him of the money pouch he just stole, ya ken?

**Requirements**: Accuracy 2+, Perception 2+.

**Novice**: You learn the Blasters Weapon Group. If you already know it, you gain the Accuracy (Blasters) focus. Also, you can easily switch between weapons. Swapping your current weapon for a sheathed or stowed weapon is a free action instead of the usual minor action.

**Journeyman**: You are deadly with a melee weapon and firearm. When dual-wielding a melee weapon and blaster, you receive a +1 bonus on all your damage rolls.

**Master**: You are a storm of steel and blaster bolts. If you make a melee attack with your primary weapon and are not charging, you may make a ranged attack with your secondary blaster as a minor action. The second attack cannot generate stunt points. You may only add half your Perception (rounded down) to the damage roll.

<a name="templar"></a>
## Templar
To become a priest, one must simply profess faith. To become a templar, you have placed yourself in the hands of your deity as a weapon. You may lack the weapons training and fighting styles of the warrior, but you make up for it with arcane might. You are more than an armored magus; you are capable of channeling your magical might in the thick of battle as the hammer of your deity's judgment.

**Primary Abilities**: Constitution, Fighting, Intelligence, Willpower.

**Secondary Abilities**: Accuracy, Communication, Dexterity, Perception, Strength.

**Starting Health**: 25 + Constitution + 1d6

**Weapon Groups**: Bows, Brawling, Staves, Bludgeons

**Class Cross-Training**: For the purpose of taking talents, you are both a Mage and a Warrior.

#### Level 19
**New Talent**: You become a Novice in a new talent, or gain a degree in a talent you already have.

#### Level 20
**Epic Templar**: Pick one type of stunt: Combat, Exploration or Roleplaying. You gain a permanent +1 bonus when generating stunt points of that type.

### Templar Specializations

#### Blackguard

Some Templar are beacons of light and righteousness. You are *not* one of them. By the calling of your god or a shadow across your soul, you have become a bastion of fear. You are dark redoubt of divine might.

#### Inquisitor

You are the embodiment of divine justice. Those who have sinned in the eyes of your god have no sanctuary from you. You will find those who have earned your retribution, you shall give them no quarter... for justice will not dispense itself.

**Requirements**: Perception 2+, Observation (Novice) talent.

**Novice**: You single out an opponent for justice. With an Activate action, designate one enemy you can see within 10 yards as your Quarry. You receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls made against your Quarry.
