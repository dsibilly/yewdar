## Kulturia

![](/assets/Kulturia.png)

An old, proud nation; home to the Osan human peoples. Formerly colonized by the Alsan peoples of the Aqori Imperium, this land was formerly called Nevrodt. The Osan natives eventually overthrew Nevrodtim and established their own kingdom. Kulturia used to the be premiere military and commercial power on the continent until a few decades ago when the eastern portion of their nation seceded in the Bloodless War and became Laurentia. Kulturia's climate is cold-to-temperate, with rich traditions of sailing, fishing, and animal husbandry. The government is a hereditary monarchy, with a number of aristocratic houses ruling the various cities and provinces that answer to the throne. The current reigning monarch is Queen Alasce.

## Laurentia

A mercantile oligarchy that separated from Kulturia some 25 years ago. Home to Apex City, the great metropolis of the Osenian continent. Run by a council of powerful commercial enterprises and merchant houses, Laurentia is the largest producer of arcanathyst in the world. They have a large population of Talosan, artificial constructs, which were built to serve as an army in what was assumed to be a civil war against the Kulturian crown. When Kulturia stood down their forces on the eve of battle in what would be known as the Bloodless War, the Talosan were found to have developed sentience. They have since integrated (somewhat) into society. Laurentia is governed by the Board of Ministers. The current First Minister is Dimitri Vengar, owner of the Mesa Yield Mining company.

## The Reisian Principalities

![](/assets/Reisian_Principalities.png)

An archipelago of seven islands off the southeast coast of Osenia, the Reisian Principalities are the political homeland of the Hin people, the folks most know as halflings. 

There are actually dozens of islands large and small in the Reisian Principalties, but the seven largest are the following:
- Hinkios
- Sokos
- Taros
- Raxos
- Korfea
- Phodes
- Icalonia

These seven islands exist as independent states that trade and negotiate with each other as other nations do, while interacting with all *other* nations as a single entity. This tends to make Reisian politics very complex. The capital of the Principalities is the city of Hinshire, on the island of Hinkios. It's a major port for trade with the halflings, orcs, Cheland, and northern Osenia. The islands' low latitude and tropical climate also make them a destination for well-heeled tourists, sea- and air-going merchants, and explorers of all kinds.

The Principalities are run by a council known as the Synod of Princes, with delegates from each island state. There is no official, singular leader, but in practice Hinkian Prince Xenophus Managos regulates the pulse of the Synod in international affairs.

### History of the Principalities

In the early Mourning Age, King Kulturon I designated his halfling comrade Reis Eliade as the Crown Expeditioner. Her first task was to travel around the continent and return with an accurate map. Reis would return seven years later with her completed map… along with artifacts and observations from all the various regions of the continent. For her astounding accomplishment, the King granted Reis (now called Reis the Wanderer or Reis the Grand Explorer) and her people the islands off the continent's southeast coast. The islands were not technically Kulturia's to *give,* mind you… but there were also no existing communities living there at the time, so there was no one to complain about the new arrivals.

## Hol Khozet

![](/assets/Hol_Khozet.png)

The vast jungles of Southern Osenia. While not an officially declared nation as others might be, all other countries respect the jungles as de facto sovereign territory of the orcish people. The jungles themselves are dense, dark, and dangerous to lifeforms not prepared for its vicious cycles of life and death. The orcs themselves have extensive contact with the rest of the world, but not as a single entity. There are thirteen orcish clans, and each has its own traditions and opinions on dealing with other peoples and travel to other lands. There is a history of bitter conflict between the orcs and the dwarves of Grendia, with whom they share the longest national border on the continent.

## Grendia

![](/assets/Grendia.png)

The Eternal Holdfast of Grendia-Under-The-Mountains, known colloquially as Grendia, is a massive surface and subterranean kingdom ruled over and populated by the dwarves of Yewdar. The nation, and the Grendian mountain range that spans it, bisects the continent of Osenia into western and eastern halves.

Seven massive underground cities exist beneath the mountains, but few outsiders ever get to venture beneath the surface, as the dwarves are a gruff and private people. There are also a number of surface or hybrid settlements along the length of the mountain range, and these settlements tend to be more welcoming of outsiders (but not by much). In the southern reaches, surface settlements are more common, but there are frequent skirmishes between the orc clans of Hol Khozet and the dwarf clans of Grendia.

The center of Grendian political life is in Rockhome, ancestral home of the Axforge clan and situated south of the mountain passes that link the Great Osenian Highroad between Fort Dori in Kulturia and The Anvil in Laurentia. Rockhome is where the two political entities of the dwarven government meet. The first is a feudal council known as the Clansraed. The Clansraed is a hereditary council of feudal aristocrats that expresses the will of the clans from across the mountains. The second is the Crown, a hereditary monarchy maintained by the current ruling clan, who leads all of the clans in war and negotiates with other nations on their behalf. The ruling clan can be replaced by another clan by rite of combat against the ruling monarch or unanimous discommendation by the entire Clansraed. Currently, the ruler is Dorin Axforge.

### Grimspire Hold

The northernmost surface settlement in the kingdom is Grimspire Hold, a sprawling complex of airship docks that serves as a waystation for travel and trade east and west across the continent.

### Highmind Monastery

A few days of challenging mountaineering north of Grimspire lies Highmind Monastery, a holy site to worshipers of Vor, goddess of Mercy, and where monks sworn to her service are trained in the frigid heights.

### Fort Dori

Fort Dori, in Kulturia, is a joint settlement in the foothills of the mountain range, staffed equally by Kulturian and Grendian forces to ensure the Highroad remains clear of threats, natural and malicious. A Kulturian Jarl and a dwarvish Rond share responsibility for the fort. Jarla Janet Dählstrom was, until very recently, the ruling Jarl at Fort Dori. A band of mercenaries unraveled a conspiracy involving the Jarla and a coven of bandits, resulting in her arrest and the current regency of her son, Torsten Dählstrom.

### The Anvil
The Anvil is a hybrid settlement on the Laurentian side of the mountain range. It is a basalt fortress carved from the very rock of the foothills, with an external wall and town outside a set of massive stone doors leading into the depths.

## Cheland

![](/assets/Cheland.png)

Cheland is not a single nation. The island sub-continent is bisected by the same mountain range that forms Grendia on the mainland. To the north of the mountains are thousands of square kilometers of prairie plains that host the most productive agriculture in the region. South of the mountains lies a dank fungal forest that contains exotic and gargantuan mushrooms and other spore-based life… including the enigmatic myconids. The mountain range itself is a jagged ridge crowned by an active volcano that the native Irsan human peoples call "the Forge." Cheland's Irsan culture is the only democracy on the continent; their monarch is elected by popular vote to a six year term. The current queen is Rike Trubel, a rice farmer from the Lake Edi region.

## Cthene

![](/assets/Cthene.png)

Cthene is not technically a nation-state, but a large expanse of desert in the west of Osenia, south of Kulturia.

The ancient homeland of the vanished dragons, Cthene was once a densely forested land. The dragons claimed it as a meeting ground after the turmoil of the Black Age. Over time, more and more wyrms migrated to Cthene, giving up their far-flung lairs and hunting grounds for their new home. As the dragons congregated, they started taking less of an interest in the world beyond their borders, becoming even more aloof to the affairs of mortals than they were before. And when they did take an interest, it was no longer benevolent. The dragons created the drakon, draconian humanoids, via their magical experiments, and sent them out into the world to pursue their interests. The dragons themselves, though, tended to stay in Cthene, consumed with a task that the other nations and cultures could only guess at. They did, however, align themselves with (tolerate) the overthrown Nevrodt Empire.

On the last day of the Tempest Age, the Day of Broken Scales, something went horribly wrong in Cthene. A magical cataclysm shook the continent, centered on the dragon capital Tyr. When the cataclysm subsided, Cthene was uprooted. The forests and rolling hills were pulverized. Nothing but ruins and dust remained for hundreds of miles. Even more mysteriously, the dragons that populated Cthene disappeared.

Modern-day Cthene is dotted with rock outcroppings, treacherous cliffs, and the ruins of dragon cities. The drakon people, left behind after the mysterious disappearance of their dragon creators, continue to live in the Cthene Wastes in small, nomadic communities. They eke out a living in the Cthene Wastes, taking shelter from the unforgiving desert climate in a series of protected sietches: rock formations that provide shelter from the sandstorms and brutal daytime sun. Because of this, their communities are also called sietches. These tribes are not full aligned with each other, and there is no functioning "national" government in the desert.

The effects of the Day of Broken Scales continues to make themselves known in Cthene. Magic doesn't work here consistently. Sometimes spells and rituals work normally, sometimes they don't work at all, and sometimes they have wild effects. Airships cannot fly over the Wastes. Those that try plummet right out of the sky just a few miles inside the edge of the sands.

There are a few points of interest to explorers and adventurers braving the arid wastelands of Cthene.
- Dusthold
- The Ruins of Tyr
- The Temple Complex at Taza

### Dusthold

Dusthold is one of the only open sietch communities. Typically, the drakon of the deserts keep to themselves and shun outsiders, but not here. This bustling town of 3,000 serves as a border trading post at the desert's edge and is considered by most to be the gateway to the wastes.

### The Ruins of Tyr

The ruins of the dragon capital at Tyr are a sobering spectacle of power and decay. Huge buildings made for dragons lie here in pieces, half-buried in sand. The Eye, a violent nexus of magical energy, hovers over the city and makes travel here very unpredictable and dangerous.

### Taza

Taza was the temple city of the dragons, where the twelve species of wyrm would gather to venerate the deities who created them. Oddly untouched by the cataclysm, the temple complex has thwarted historians & grave robbers alike with cruel and cunning booby-traps.
