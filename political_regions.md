## Kulturia

![](/assets/Kulturia.png)

An old, proud nation; home to the Osan human peoples. Formerly colonized by the Alsan peoples of the Aqori  Imperium, this land was formerly called Nevrodt. The Osan natives eventually overthrew Nevrodtim and established their own kingdom. Kulturia used to the be premiere military and commercial power on the continent until a few decades ago when the eastern portion of their nation seceded in the Bloodless War and became Laurentia. Kulturia's climate is cold-to-temperate, with rich traditions of sailing, fishing, and animal husbandry. The government is a hereditary monarchy, with a number of aristocratic houses ruling the various cities and provinces that answer to the throne. The current reigning monarch is Queen Alasce.

## Laurentia

A mercantile oligarchy that separated from Kulturia some 25 years ago. Home to Apex City, the great metropolis of the Osenian continent. Run by a council of powerful commercial enterprises and merchant houses, Laurentia is the largest producer of arcanathyst in the world. They have a large population of Talosan, artificial constructs, which were built to serve as an army in what was assumed to be a civil war against the Kulturian crown. When Kulturia stood down their forces on the eve of battle in what would be known as the Bloodless War, the Talosan were found to have developed sentience. They have since integrated (somewhat) into society. Laurentia is governed by the Board of Ministers. The current First Minister is Dimitri Vengar, owner of the Mesa Yield Mining company.

## The Reisian Principalities

An archipelago of seven islands off the southeast coast of Osenia, the Reisian Principalities are the political homeland of the halfling peoples. The islands were granted to their first leader, Reis the Grand Explorer, as a boon for her intrepid expedition to map the entirety of the continent. The Principalities are seven independent states that trade and negotiate with each other as others do, while interacting as a single nation with other countries. The seven islands are Hinkios, Sokos, Taros, Raxos, Korfea, Phodes, and Icalonia. Their low latitude and tropical climate make the islands a destination for well-heeled tourists, sea- and air-going merchants, and explorers of all kinds. Their capital, Hinshire upon the big island of Hinkios, is a major port for trade with the halflings, orcs, Cheland and northern Osenia.

## Hol Khozet

The vast jungles of Southern Osenia. While not an officially declared nation as others might be, all other countries respect the jungles as de facto sovereign territory of the orcish people. The jungles themselves are dense, dark, and dangerous to lifeforms not prepared for its vicious cycles of life and death. The orcs themselves have extensive contact with the rest of the world, but not as a single entity. There are thirteen orcish clans, and each has its own traditions and opinions on dealing with other peoples and travel to other lands. There is a history of bitter conflict between the orcs and the dwarves of Grendia, with whom they share the longest national border on the continent.

## Grendia

Slicing through the continent, the Grendian mountain range is home to Osenia's dwarven peoples. They are a tough and gruff race of disciplined warriors and craftspeople whose concept of honor and service are renowned across the continent. The dwarves live in great holds beneath the mountains, their subterranean cities and villages crafted by their steady, patient hands. They are an intensely private people, and few outsiders ever get to venture beneath the surface. The dwarven government has two political entities: the crown and a feudal council known as the Clansraed. The Clansraed is a hereditary council of feudal aristocrats that expresses the will of the clans from across the mountains. The Crown is a hereditary monarchy maintained by the current ruling clan, who leads the clans in war and negotiates with other nations on their behalf. The ruling clan can be replaced by another clan by rite of combat against the ruling monarch or unanimous discommendation by the entire Clansraed. The current ruler is Dorin Axforge, who rules the clans from his clan's ancestral hold at Rockhome in central Grendia.

## Cheland

Cheland is not a single nation. The island sub-continent is bisected by the same mountain range that forms Grendia on the mainland. To the north of the mountains are thousands of square kilometers of prairie plains that host the most productive agriculture in the region. South of the mountains lies a dank fungal forest that contains exotic and gargantuan mushrooms and other spore-based lifeâ€¦ including the enigmatic myconids. The mountain range itself is a jagged ridge crowned by an active volcano that the native Irsan human peoples call "the Forge." Cheland's Irsan culture is the only democracy on the continent; their monarch is elected by popular vote to a six year term. The current queen is Rike Trubel, a rice farmer from the Lake Edi region.

## Cthene

Cthene is not technically a nation-state. A large expanse of desert south of Kulturia, it is the former location of a dragon empire that aligned itself with the overthrown Nevrodt Empire. When the Day of Broken Scales transpired, the dragons that populated Cthene disappeared, and a natural disaster turned the region from grasslands and hill country into leagues of barren desert. Many bands of Drakon, left behind by their dragon creators, eek out a living in the Cthene Wastes. They band together in nomadic tribes that take shelter from the unforgiving desert climate in a series of protected sietches: rock formations that provide shelter from the sandstorms and brutal daytime sun. These tribes are not full aligned with each other, and there is no functioning "national" government in the desert.
