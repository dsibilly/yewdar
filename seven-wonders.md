# Seven Wonders of the World

Similar to Earth, there are locations that are spectacular enough to warrant a special category, that of a wonder of Yewdar. They appear below (in random order).

## 1. The Ruins of Tyr, Cthene Wastes

Destroyed capital city of the dragon empire. The buildings were draconic (read: very large) in scale. Now abandoned, Tyr is a silent memorial to its departed makers.

## 2. The Temple Complex of Taza, Cthene Wastes

While Tyr was the dragon's city, Taza was their center of worship. A dozen ziggurats stand here, untouched by the cataclysm that created the desert wates. Its deadly traps and safeguards make it a mystery to all.

## 3. The Tree Cities of Khosat, Aqori Imperium

The forests of Khosat, where the Qandaha minotaurs make their home, are crowned by communities that make their homes among their branches in skillfully built villages.

## 4. The Tower of Twilight, Sa Shaeras, Na'riel

In the ancient capital of the elves, the Tower of Twilight was sculpted of wood and obsidian, crowned with a mother-of-pearl spire 300 meters above its base. This is where the Speaker of Twilight ruled before the fall of Na'riel.

## 5. The Imperial Sepulcher, Sharain, Aqori Imperium

The ancestral burial site of the Imperators, the Sepulcher lies in a rocky valley outside the capital at Sharain. A group of mausoleums store the remains and worldly possessions of Aqori rulers going back to the Tempest Age.

## 6. The Colosseum at Kulturnost, Kulturia

Built by the Nevrodt Empire, the colosseum was originally a penal facility, used for trial by combat for convicted criminals (guilty or not.) It later was used for entertainment, and continues to host gladiatorial battles today.

## 7. Apex City, Laurentia

Capital of the Laurentian Oligarchy, Apex City is Yewdar's true metropolis. Built upon a huge mesa rising from flat plains, it is a city of towers rising to the sky and interwoven with skybridges.
