# The Dragons of Yewdar

*From* A Draconic Overview * by Holfastor Gorm, Professor of Draconic Studies, Stromgaarten College*

Some four centuries ago, the dragons of old vanished from our world. We do not know whence they have gone. We carry stories of them in our myths and legends, and while many of them may be outlanding there is a grain of truth to every mythic story. Over my long career, I have scoured the world with teams of diligent archaeologists and researchers, searching out stories, records, and first-hand accounts of the dragons.

This document is a synopsis of that research. We begin with the Elven creation myth pertaining to dragons, the *Suzoryu*. We follow with a historical synopsis of the dragon's interactions with mortal civilization culminating in their disappearance on the Day of Broken Scales. We conclude with a treatise of the twelve known species of dragonkind drawn from the fossil record, historical accounts, and interviews with some few long-lived individuals who purport to have encountered dragons personally. We have collected, cross-referenced and verified to best academic rigor possible a staggering amount of data for this work, and it is my belief that the result is the most accurate portrayal of the wryms that once dominated our world.

Should the dragons return to Yewdar, it is my sincere hope that this work shall serve as a valuable primer that will allow the mortal races to begin their relationships anew with our predecessors from a place of greater knowledge and understanding than would otherwise be possible.

## The Suzoryu
or, *The Creation of the Dragons*

I.

When the gods finished their Great Work, they paused amid their new creation. N'er, the Allsaga, began to divide moments into enumerable pieces, and time began to flow. The world before them grew and blossomed. Chaos yielded to the might of divine will, and all was ordered to their whim. The gods were pleased.

The gods spoke: This was their realm, and they would make it endure. They would bring forth beings strong of body and keen of mind to assist them in the upkeep of their creations. The would create the first life of the newborn world: dragons.

Thus were the dragons created.

Each god took to their own affairs in the peace of their new realm. Some gods gathered together, while others held themselves apart.

II.

The three gods of light rested in a fortress, surrounded by mountains and crashing rivers.

"MIGHT!" Powerful Ka muttered to herself in a voice that shattered a mountain and bathed a valley in darkness as the stars fled trembling before her. "We must needs STRENGTH to preserve our realm. None shall be stronger than we are!" Impulsively, Ka reached out and tore a mountain from the ground by its peak. Her fingers dug into the weak rock, prying it away until naught but solid stone remained. Inhaling the light of the sun with a deep breath, Ka roared into the stone. The light of the sun took refuge from Ka's fury inside the stone, and there it quivered as she roared on and on. For twelve days and twelve nights did she roar. On the morning of the 13th day by N'er's reckoning, the stone did a curious thing: it roared back. The sun fled from the sky and hid behind the moon, refusing to come out for six days.

Where a stone had been, Ka's dragon stood. It was stronger than the rock of our world, for it had the light of the sun inside it. "Ha!" shouted Ka, scaring the oceans from their placid shores. "You I shall name **Kasalt**, for you are made by Ka and by stone!" And Ka and Kasalt roared at each other in delight.

Dynu did see the work of Ka and knew that his dragon must be fearless in Ka and Kasalt's imposing presence. He strode forth from the fortress and searched nearby where all things had fled Ka and her dragon. Dynu searched, though the sun trembled behind the moon and bathed the land in darkness. He searched high and low for even a single creation that did not quail before his sister's terrible exuberance. But what could brave that which scared even the sun?

On the morning of the fourth day, he heard a call from below.

"Have a care for where your feet land! If you stomp upon me, you should never hear the end of my fury!"

Great Dynu bent down to the ground to see what would speak to him so. "Who speaks so boldly to a lord of this realm?"

"I do!" The voice came from a small bird, white of breast, black of beak, and roan-feathered besides.

"And just who are you?" asked Dynu, for he had not seen such a creature before.

"I am the sparrow, great lord, and I will not be stepped upon by anyone, not even a mighty god!" The sparrow flapped its wings and flew up even unto Dynu's face a great height above the ground. "What say you to *that*, great lord?"

Dynu laughed, his mirth blowing great gusts of wind agains the tiny sparrow, who remained yet unmoved. "Friend sparrow, you are brave beyond measure, and this world shall have need of such mettle. I would make you greater than you could imagine, that your bravery will inspire all others yet to come within our realm."

The sparrow considered for a day and a night before it assented to Dynu's will. Dynu reached out with his hands and pulled upon the sparrow's head, wings, legs and body. He pulled and molded for an entire day. When the sun returned he beheld **Ynrrow** the Fearless, who preened herself unfazed by her change in nature and aspect, for such was as she was meant to be. Dynu climbed upon Ynrrow's broad, feathered back and together they flew back to the fortress.

Merciful Vor watched her companions at work. When the sun fled behind the moon, she grew concerned. She ascended to the moon to console the sun. So moved was she by its plight that tears flowed down her face, even as she entreated the sun with tales of the world it would light when it made itself known again. For six days she did importune the sun, and for six days did she weep in compassion. On the sixth day the sun regained its courage and returned to the skies. Vor embraced both the sun and moon in her delight, and flew back down to the fortress.

As she approached the fortress and beheld the creations of Ka and Dynu, she felt talons grasp her shoulder. She turned to see a dragon, liquid in form and illuminated from within by the mingled light of sun and moon. Born from the very tears Vor shed while consoling the sun, **Vorun** followed his mother into the fortress and mediated the endless struggle between Kasalt's strength and Ynrrow's unyielding bravery.

III.

Enakoh walked the face of the world. He walked away from his brethren until he could no longer see his counterpart Abasys. He knew that she had a purpose just as he did, but he could not reconcile with it. He smiled, and life grew around him. Beings of all kinds sprung forth and congregated in the wake of his passage: beings large and small, no two alike. As Enakoh traversed the world, he eventually returned to where he had started... and there he found dying his first creations.

A sigh of grief escaped him, and drifted across the land. He stood there for uncounted time contemplating loss. When his grief passed, he noticed that his breath had brought forth renewal and rebirth. From the bodies of his first creations, new life arose. Filled with passionate joy and inspiration, he called to his brother N'er, a quarter of the world away.

"Brother N'er, you measure the passage of things, yes? You know how long they exist?" N'er nodded. "Give me a small bit of your time, that I may have my presence everywhere, bringing new life where this death occurs!" N'er nodded a second time.

Enakoh took a quantum of time from N'er and molded it into a small drake, which darted faster than the eye could see. In an instant, death before him was renewed. He smiled and spoke to the drake. "You shall be **Sysaba**, for you are the opposite of my counterpart in all things, same as I." Pleased with his work, Enakoh continued to walk the face of the world.

Abasys felt the distant presence of Enakoh as he receeded from her, and when she felt that he could be no farther without him drawing closer once again, she too began to walk. As she came across the first of Enakoh's creations, she sighed. They were fecund and prolific, threatening to overrun all. Her breath drifted across the land, and those living things it passed over died. Abasys contemplated their deaths, and their passing seemed right to her. With purpose, she called out to her brother N'er, a quarter of the world away.

"N'er, you measure the passage of things, yes?" N'er nodded. "Are all things to exist to the end of days, as we may? Would this creation of ours not descend into miasmic chaos if that were the case?" N'er nodded. "Give me a small section of your measure, brother, that I might know the limits of life and ensure that all things pass away when it is good and proper." N'er nodded a second time.

Abasys took the section of measure and stretched it far and wide, blanketing the world. It saw every living thing. When it exhaled, those beings whose time had come passed on, ceasing to live. She smiled and spoke to the living measure, which had taken the form of an ephemeral drake. "You, paper thin dragon, shall be known as **Veil**, for you cover all and yet see the proper ending of things." And Abasys continued to walk, staying always half a world away from Enakoh.

N'er counted. His steps kept the time of the passing seconds, each footfall landing the unwavering precision. Halfway between Enakoh and Abasys, he kept rhythm. As he walked, his count grew.

N'er gave a tiny bit of time to his brother Enakoh, that his dragon might move faster than time to ensure life's existence. He gave a section of his measure to Abasys that her dragon might know the alotted span of time for every living thing. In the space between, N'er walked.

His footsteps measured the seconds, and the minutes, and the hours, and the days, years, centuries, and millennia. Where time pooled up too many seconds, an abundance of minutes, an excess of hours... N'er would use his measure to find them and slice away the surfeit time with his curved blade. These he stored in his pouch, counting as he walked.

Seven and twenty hundred times did N'er walk about the world in perfect rhythm. Only then did he pause to contemplate the time he had collected. N'er paused. Reality paused with him. In this moment frozen between seconds he shaped the contents of his pouch into a pair of shears, which were jaws. He shaped a pair of scales, which were wings. He shaped a pair of sundials as eyes, and four metronomes as legs.

N'er did not speak. He did not need to, as the dragon knew its name. **Chron** flew behind N'er, slicing away any surfeit time and swallowing it to keep them safe. With Chron behind him, N'er continued to walk. Reality sprung into motion, and N'er counted.
