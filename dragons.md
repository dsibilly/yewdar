# The Dragons of Yewdar

*From* **A Draconic Overview** *by Holfastor Gorm, Professor of Draconic Studies, Stromgaarten College*

Some four centuries ago, the dragons of old vanished from our world. We do not know whence they have gone. We carry stories of them in our myths and legends, and while many of them may be outlanding there is a grain of truth to every mythic story. Over my long career, I have scoured the world with teams of diligent archaeologists and researchers, searching out stories, records, and first-hand accounts of the dragons.

This document is a synopsis of that research. We begin with the Elven creation myth pertaining to dragons, the *Suzoryu*. We follow with a historical synopsis of the dragon's interactions with mortal civilization culminating in their disappearance on the Day of Broken Scales. We conclude with a treatise of the twelve known species of dragonkind drawn from the fossil record, historical accounts, and interviews with some few long-lived individuals who purport to have encountered dragons personally. We have collected, cross-referenced and verified to best academic rigor possible a staggering amount of data for this work, and it is my belief that the result is the most accurate portrayal of the wryms that once dominated our world.

Should the dragons return to Yewdar, it is my sincere hope that this work shall serve as a valuable primer that will allow the mortal races to begin their relationships anew with our predecessors from a place of greater knowledge and understanding than would otherwise be possible.

## The Suzoryu
or, *The Creation of the Dragons*

As related by Tariel Gar'Vaneth the Golden-tongued, Bard of the Eldar Fleet.

### I.

When the gods finished their Great Work, they paused amid their new creation. N'er, the Allsaga, began to divide moments into enumerable pieces, and time began to flow. The world before them grew and blossomed. Chaos yielded to the might of divine will, and all was ordered to their whim. The gods were pleased.

The gods spoke: This was their realm, and they would make it endure. They would bring forth beings strong of body and keen of mind to assist them in the upkeep of their creations. The would create the first life of the newborn world: dragons.

Thus were the dragons created.

Each god took to their own affairs in the peace of their new realm. Some gods gathered together, while others held themselves apart.

### II.

The three gods of light rested in a fortress, surrounded by mountains and crashing rivers.

"MIGHT!" Powerful Ka muttered to herself in a voice that shattered a mountain and bathed a valley in darkness as the stars fled trembling before her. "We must needs STRENGTH to preserve our realm. None shall be stronger than we are!" Impulsively, Ka reached out and tore a mountain from the ground by its peak. Her fingers dug into the weak rock, prying it away until naught but solid stone remained. Inhaling the light of the sun with a deep breath, Ka roared into the stone. The light of the sun took refuge from Ka's fury inside the stone, and there it quivered as she roared on and on. For twelve days and twelve nights did she roar. On the morning of the 13th day by N'er's reckoning, the stone did a curious thing: it roared back. The sun fled from the sky and hid behind the moon, refusing to come out for six days.

Where a stone had been, Ka's dragon stood. It was stronger than the rock of our world, for it had the light of the sun inside it. "Ha!" shouted Ka, scaring the oceans from their placid shores. "You I shall name **Kasalt**, for you are made by Ka and by stone!" And Ka and Kasalt roared at each other in delight.

Dynu did see the work of Ka and knew that his dragon must be fearless in Ka and Kasalt's imposing presence. He strode forth from the fortress and searched nearby where all things had fled Ka and her dragon. Dynu searched, though the sun trembled behind the moon and bathed the land in darkness. He searched high and low for even a single creation that did not quail before his sister's terrible exuberance. But what could brave that which scared even the sun?

On the morning of the fourth day, he heard a call from below.

"Have a care for where your feet land! If you stomp upon me, you should never hear the end of my fury!"

Great Dynu bent down to the ground to see what would speak to him so. "Who speaks so boldly to a lord of this realm?"

"I do!" The voice came from a small bird, white of breast, black of beak, and roan-feathered besides.

"And just who are you?" asked Dynu, for he had not seen such a creature before.

"I am the sparrow, great lord, and I will not be stepped upon by anyone, not even a mighty god!" The sparrow flapped its wings and flew up even unto Dynu's face a great height above the ground. "What say you to *that*, great lord?"

Dynu laughed, his mirth blowing great gusts of wind agains the tiny sparrow, who remained yet unmoved. "Friend sparrow, you are brave beyond measure, and this world shall have need of such mettle. I would make you greater than you could imagine, that your bravery will inspire all others yet to come within our realm."

The sparrow considered for a day and a night before it assented to Dynu's will. Dynu reached out with his hands and pulled upon the sparrow's head, wings, legs and body. He pulled and molded for an entire day. When the sun returned he beheld **Ynrrow** the Fearless, who preened herself unfazed by her change in nature and aspect, for such was as she was meant to be. Dynu climbed upon Ynrrow's broad, feathered back and together they flew back to the fortress.

Merciful Vor watched her companions at work. When the sun fled behind the moon, she grew concerned. She ascended to the moon to console the sun. So moved was she by its plight that tears flowed down her face, even as she entreated the sun with tales of the world it would light when it made itself known again. For six days she did importune the sun, and for six days did she weep in compassion. On the sixth day the sun regained its courage and returned to the skies. Vor embraced both the sun and moon in her delight, and flew back down to the fortress.

As she approached the fortress and beheld the creations of Ka and Dynu, she felt talons grasp her shoulder. She turned to see a dragon, liquid in form and illuminated from within by the mingled light of sun and moon. Born from the very tears Vor shed while consoling the sun, **Vorun** followed his mother into the fortress and mediated the endless struggle between Kasalt's strength and Ynrrow's unyielding bravery.

### III.

Enakoh walked the face of the world. He walked away from his brethren until he could no longer see his counterpart Abasys. He knew that she had a purpose just as he did, but he could not reconcile with it. He smiled, and life grew around him. Beings of all kinds sprung forth and congregated in the wake of his passage: beings large and small, no two alike. As Enakoh traversed the world, he eventually returned to where he had started... and there he found dying his first creations.

A sigh of grief escaped him, and drifted across the land. He stood there for uncounted time contemplating loss. When his grief passed, he noticed that his breath had brought forth renewal and rebirth. From the bodies of his first creations, new life arose. Filled with passionate joy and inspiration, he called to his brother N'er, a quarter of the world away.

"Brother N'er, you measure the passage of things, yes? You know how long they exist?" N'er nodded. "Give me a small bit of your time, that I may have my presence everywhere, bringing new life where this death occurs!" N'er nodded a second time.

Enakoh took a quantum of time from N'er and molded it into a small drake, which darted faster than the eye could see. In an instant, death before him was renewed. He smiled and spoke to the drake. "You shall be **Sysaba**, for you are the opposite of my counterpart in all things, same as I." Pleased with his work, Enakoh continued to walk the face of the world.

Abasys felt the distant presence of Enakoh as he receeded from her, and when she felt that he could be no farther without him drawing closer once again, she too began to walk. As she came across the first of Enakoh's creations, she sighed. They were fecund and prolific, threatening to overrun all. Her breath drifted across the land, and those living things it passed over died. Abasys contemplated their deaths, and their passing seemed right to her. With purpose, she called out to her brother N'er, a quarter of the world away.

"N'er, you measure the passage of things, yes?" N'er nodded. "Are all things to exist to the end of days, as we may? Would this creation of ours not descend into miasmic chaos if that were the case?" N'er nodded. "Give me a small section of your measure, brother, that I might know the limits of life and ensure that all things pass away when it is good and proper." N'er nodded a second time.

Abasys took the section of measure and stretched it far and wide, blanketing the world. It saw every living thing. When it exhaled, those beings whose time had come passed on, ceasing to live. She smiled and spoke to the living measure, which had taken the form of an ephemeral drake. "You, paper thin dragon, shall be known as **Veil**, for you cover all and yet see the proper ending of things." And Abasys continued to walk, staying always half a world away from Enakoh.

N'er counted. His steps kept the time of the passing seconds, each footfall landing with unwavering precision. Halfway between Enakoh and Abasys, he kept rhythm. As he walked, his count grew.

N'er gave a tiny bit of time to his brother Enakoh, that his dragon might move faster than time to ensure life's existence. He gave a section of his measure to Abasys that her dragon might know the alotted span of time for every living thing. In the space between, N'er walked.

His footsteps measured the seconds, and the minutes, and the hours, and the days, years, centuries, and millennia. Where time pooled up too many seconds, an abundance of minutes, an excess of hours... N'er would use his measure to find them and slice away the surfeit time with his curved blade. These he stored in his pouch, counting as he walked.

Seven and twenty hundred times did N'er walk about the world in perfect rhythm. Only then did he pause to contemplate the time he had collected. N'er paused. Reality paused with him. In this moment frozen between seconds he shaped the contents of his pouch into a pair of shears, which were jaws. He shaped a pair of scales, which were wings. He shaped a pair of sundials as eyes, and four metronomes as legs.

N'er did not speak. He did not need to, as the dragon knew its name. **Chron** flew behind N'er, slicing away any surfeit time and swallowing it to keep them safe. With Chron behind him, N'er continued to walk. Reality sprung into motion, and N'er counted.

### IV.

Meno watched her fellow gods. She catalogued their actions. She noted the names and aspects of their dragons. She accumulated knowledge.

When her knowledge grew ponderous, she began to write down all that she learned. She walked the world learning all that could be learned, trailing scrolls of knowledge in her wake. The her mind emptied onto the scrolls, and she walked ever on to keep filling it with anew.

The scrolls crissed and crossed behind her, layer upon layer, weaving a random pattern of truth and observation. After sixteen weeks of walking, writing, cataloguing, Meno sheathed her quill and turns to look behind her. The pile of scrolls heaved and shuddered. She pulled upon a corner of the pile, and then another. The pattern of parchment coalesced into a winged form. "**Scrol**," Meno said, for she already knew the drake, "you store a portion of my knowledge and will be my reference and companion." The dragon nodded, for so great was the knowledge from which it was formed that it already knew these things. Meno and Scrol continued their journey, for there is always more to learn.

When the other gods slept, Jashus awoke. When the other gods awoke, Jashus slept. He drifted through the dreams of all the world's beings. He knew their hopes and fears, their cravings and their aversions. In dreams, he found unnumbered possibilities and impossibilities, facets of existence both sublime and terrifying. Jashus meandered in these places for an uncountable span; even N'er did not know how long, for dreams are timeless.

When Jashus awoke, he noted that the world had moved as he slumbered. He saw that actuality had been distilled from possibility, and his dreaming had shown him ways forward even from here.

And for another time, Jashus slept.

He sought out the dreams of the dragons he brethren had made. From these he pulled together gossamer strands of thought and desire and fear, and he wove a new drake upon his loom. "**Dhrus**, you are my connection to the Waking World," said Jashus. The dragon spread its wings, covering the sky of Vakaré, the Dream Realm and enveloping Jashus like a blanket. "You are my eyes in the world. If I should be needed, call to me and I shall awaken." Dhrus nodded, opening one eye to the Waking World that he might see what transpired there. The other eye he kept shut so as to see the Dream Realm.

And Jashus slept, knowing he would be called upon if there was need.

Mym capered.

Mym pranced.

Mym danced upon sundust. She floated across starbeams.

Mym saw the other gods' creations and trusted that, soon, she would have a drake of her own. She wandered the world haphazardly, going where whim took her, and she stumbled across some of the grandest wonders yet to be revealed.

A voice called out to her. "Hello!"

"Yes, who calls?" said Mym.

"Me!"

"Who is 'Me'?"

"I am Me, and it is lucky indeed that you have happened upon my home."

Mym agreed. Luck was ever by her side.

"Are you, by chance, a dragon?" Mym asked, for she longed for her own dragon.

"I am!" said the voice.

Mym's eyes narrowed. "How can I believe you?" she wondered aloud.

"Would any but a dragon have wings like *this*?" said the voice, rising up and spreading its wings. Mym had to agree that the wings were *very* dragon-like.

"And would any but a dragon have teeth like *this*?" The voice snapped its teeth near Mym's face. As luck would have it, it only clipped a single hair from her brow. Mym agreed that the teeth were *very* dragon-like.

"Would any but a dragon have luck such as *this*?" The voice produced a coin, and flipped it. "HEADS!" it cried, and the coin landed heads-up. It flipped the coin again and cried "TAILS!," and the coin landed tails-up. Mym agreed that such luck was *very* dragon-like.

"I have been searching for a dragon," said Mym, "and it is lucky that I have found one! Would you caper and prance and float with me?" The voice considered this in a very dragon-like manner... and it consented. The consent, too, was also very dragon-like.

Mym continued on with the voice following along behind. Mym knew the dragon would need a name, but she trusted that she would come across one when the time was right.

### V.

Gur stormed away from the places where the other gods dwelled in search of a worthy fight. None of her brethren would contend with her, and none of them wanted to consistently fight by her side  She tired of fighting alone. Gur always craved conflict, but even moreso she wanted someone to accompany her into battle.

She searched across the world. She argued with the stones and the trees. She picked fights with birds and hares. She joined battle with insects, salamanders, and more. After each conflict she would challenge them to stand with her, no matter the fight, no matter the cost. Some did stand with her... for a time. A badger was her companion for a week, but it grew tired. She fought beside a hummingbird for a day, but it could not move quickly enough for her liking. For a time she even rested with a sloth, and that span was the only measure of time where the world knew true peace.

Gur grew tired of the land and the air and the fickle creatures who could not be her stalwart companions. She dove beneath the waters to continue her search, plumbing the depths to fight with sharks, dolphins, whales, and even anglerfish. After months of searching, she despaired of ever finding one who shared her thirst for fury and conflict.

She was about to resign herself to an eternity of solitary battle when she felt a pinch on her calf, followed by a thunderous *POP*.

"WHO IS IT WHO DARES?" Gur roared in the deep.

"I do!" piped a small voice. It came from a diminuitive shrimp, sharp of claw and luminously beautiful of shell. "You have been hunting for weeks, and I have used up every store of my patience waiting for you to notice me. I will not have it any longer!" The shrimp's claw darted out, rushing through the water with such force that it turned to boiling vapor that snapped in on itself with an explosive flash. Again, Gur felt a pinch on her calf, and saw blood ooze from the wound.

Gur smiled and began to duel the shrimp with delight. For weeks they fought, neither giving any quarter. The small being's shell was tough and resisted Gur's rage-fueled attacks. It's eyes were keen and it anticipated most of her attacks. It's claws were sharp. As they fought, the water became tinged with red from the Goddess of War's blood.

Gur laughed. "Would you fight by my side, little one? Would you stand with me in any conflict?"

In answer, the shrimp inhaled. It pulled Gur's blood from the water and into its gills. Its shell darkened, and it began to expand. Chitinous wings unfurled from its back, and its breath was a thing of mistery.

Gur nodded, pleased. "I will call you **Harbinger**, for you shall precede me as a warning to all of the conflict to come." Harbinger nodded its now large head. It flew before Gur, and the world knew of her coming.

Perak had quietly followed Gur on her quest, as wherever war goes, pain does inevitably follow. He stole from each companion Gur took on her journey a draught of pain. He took their sorrow, their loss, their suffering. He took all these and sewed them into a cloth he carried with him about his shoulders like a cloak.

His sister traveled far and wide in search of a partner, and Perak traced her path to sew together his own companion from the suffering left in her wake. At the end of Gur's journey, Perak remained in the oceans. His cloak of pain was a large, billowing thing now that floated behind him like hooded wings of darkness. He altered the cloak now, sewing up the edges, crimping and binding it, shaping it. He gave it a long trailing tail. He gave form and structure to the hooded wings. He gave it a mouth of fearsome teeth that he placed on the underside of its form, for the worst pain is that which we seek out for ourselves.

At the last, Perak took his needle and pierced his own finger. His pain flowed from the wound and he fed it to the dread thing he had made. It came to life with a shudder, and Perak strode up to it and stabbed it with his needle. The new drake shuddered in pleasure.

"You will be **Perloth**, and the world will hurt to hear the sound of your voice," Perak whispered to his companion. They left the oceans together then, searching for pain to feed upon, and bringing it with them wherever they went.

Illirael did nothing.

The sun, having returned from its refuge behind the moon, was shining on a particularly inviting rock. There Illirael sat, basking. Before too long, Kasalt happened by, its roar shaking the heavens.

"My, that is a mighty sound," remarked Illirael. "Is it possible that you have the loudest roar in all the world?" Kasalt bellowed that this was indeed the case. "Hm. I am not sure I believe that," Illirael responded. From his glorious waistcoat, he pulled a small crystal. "If you truly had the loudest roar, it would shatter this crystel with a single mighty shout!"

Kasalt breathed in and let loos a bellow which shook the world to its core. The sun, scared again, went dim from fear. The sound of the roar engulfed the crystal. The stone quivered, then shook, then shattered. A small piece of it embedded itself in Illirael's hand. "My dear dragon, I must concede that you do *indeed* have the mightiest roar." He patted the rock he sat upon with his left hand, for his right hand was bleeding. "I will sit here and consider that sound. You have given me much to think about." Kasalt bellowed happily and continued on its way.

Some time later, Perloth came by, driven by the flapping of its mighty wings. "Ah, my hand!" Illirael cried out, piteously. "I know not how *anything* could hurt more than this!" Perloth, affronted by this claim, swooped down and bit Illirael's hand. So hard was the bite that one of Perloth's needle-like teeth remained embedded in the flesh, right next to the shard of shattered crystal. "Ah!" Illirael lay back upon the rock in a near-faint. "I was wrong! I was wrong! This pain is greater..." Eyes hooded, Illirael fell unconscious. Perloth, satified, continued on its way.

Illirael dreamed. In his dream, he looked upon his injured right hand. Around the wound, a small drake flapped. "Dhrus, are you here to link my dreams to the mind of Jashus?" asked Illirael. The dragon nodded, for the dreams of gods were precious indeed. Illirael sat and contemplated the shiting dreamscape around him. He dreamed dreams deep and wide, dreams great and small. Each took shape around him. Dhrus took in all of the dreams and sent them along to Jashus. After a time, Illirael turned to the drake. "Dhrus, I am curious: of what do *you* dream?" The dragon flew around Illirael, fililng the dream space with its own wishes and desires. Dreams blossomed, grew and faded around it. Illirael was moved by what he saw, and wiped a single tear from his cheek. Dhrus, so moved by Illirael's appreciation, wept a single tear as well. The god and dragon embraced, and when they parted Illirael had a second tear on his cheek. "I thank you, Dhrus. I shall wake now that the pain from my hand has subsided. You have given me much to ponder." Dhrus nodded, and Illirael awoke.

While Illirael had slept, Mym's dragon happened by. As luck would have it, the drake had a salve in its possession, given to it by Vorun. It saw the wound upon Illirael's hand and the tears running down the god's cheek. While Illirael slept, the dragon placed Vorun's salve upon his hand and the wounds began to close. To let Illirael know who had cared for him, the dragon left the two tears, the shard, the tooth, and one of its own scales upon the rock next to the god's head. Mym's dragon felt very lucky that it had happend upon the god and was able to help!

When Illirael awoke, he saw his hand was bound and healed. He saw the scale, and the tears, and the shard, and the tooth. He took his own tear back and left the other one upon the scale. As he was organizing his possessions, Harbinger flew by. The mighty sound of his wings broke the crystal shard into two equal pieces. Illirael took his possessions and hid, for he did not want to get into a fight.

As he hid, Sysaba and Veil each flew past, remaining half a world apart from each other as their creators did. In the space between them floated a mote of substance, half life and half death. Each of the dragons were looking away from each other, so Illirael reached up and plucked the mote from the sky. The dragons were none the wiser.

The sun had returned to the sky by now, and Illirael returned to rest upon the rock, enjoying the warmth. As he did this, Scrol flew by cataloguing what it saw. Illirael cried out, "Scrol, come quickly! I have something to tell you!" The drake banked down and settled next to the god, looking expectantly at him. "I will tell you, friend Scrol, but only if you tell me something in return." The dragon thought for a moment and then agreed, for it knew that knowledge shared was not knowledge lost. The two whispered in each others' ears and were satisfied. Scrol flew away.

Illirael rested upon the rock.

Ynrrow came to the rock where Illirael rested. "Illirael, I come from Great Dynu. It is said that you are skulking about, talking to the other drakes. Such secretive activity is unbecoming, and you must cease presently."

"Me? Skulk? Perish the though!" Illirael sat up. I have been here, resting upon this rock in the sun. When it is out, anyway." The god perked up. "Ynrrow, that brings something to mind. The sun is scared so very easily. Might you be able to teach it to be brave and bold, as you are? I can think of no one more suited, save Great Dynu, who would be capable of such a feat." Ynrrow, always eager to test its mettle, flew up to the sun and began to teach it. The sun learned well, and began to shine even more brightly... so brightly, in fact, that some of the burnish of Ynrrow's scales flaked off and fell to the ground. Illirael caught a small piece of it and placed it with the rest of his belongings. "Friend Ynrrow," he cried, "thank you greatly! This rock is now perfect, and I shall rest here for some time to come!" Ynrrow flew away, pleased that Illirael wasn't skulking and that it was able to help the sun.

Illirael took his own teardrop, and held it up to the sunlight. The light passed through it and scattered over all the possessions he had obtained and scatterd upon the rock. As the light hit them, each metled and passed into the rock. With a smile, Illirael walked away. What has been a simple, sun-warmed rock was now **Melion**, his own dragon, made from the hard work and possessions of the other dragons pryed away by guile and trickery. None but Scrol and Illirael knew the truth of things.

Chron and Ne'r counted how long this took Illirael, for that is what they always did.
