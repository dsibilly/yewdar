# History

Yewdar recounts time in Ages, which are made up of years as we commonly think of them. Each Age can contain several centuries of time, and they are named according to their lasting effect upon the world. Since the end of the Black Age, the Chroniclers of N'er have received visions at the dawn of a new Age. From these visions, they divine the name of the Age to come. There are five named Ages thus far:

* [The Sublime Age](#thesublimeage)
* [The Black Age](#theblackage)
* [The Tempest Age](#thetempestage)
* [The Mourning Age](#themourningage)
* [The Broken Age](#thebrokenage)

## The Sublime Age
The Sublime Age, called the Wondrous Age by some, is an age of myth. Its events detail the creation and ordering of Yewdar, the shaping of the world, the origin of dragons, the birth of the mortal kith.

## The Black Age
During the Black Age, Yewdar was invaded by daemonic forces from planes beyond. For over two centuries the dragons and the mortal kith fought to liberate Yewdar and drive the invaders out.

## The Tempest Age
In the Tempest Age, the dragons became a much more noticable force in world affairs. They were initially a benevolent and helpful force. As the mortal nations became contentious and belligerent with each other in the competition for resources and respect, the dragons were overbearing at times... becoming downright despots in some regions of the world. The political squabbling frequently boiled over into violent conflict, and war was the ultimate flavor of the Age.

The Tempest Age is closed with the Day of Broken Scales. A cataclysm strikes the dragon empire of Cthene in northern Osenia, wiping out their cities and temples and turning their stark badlands into a featureless desert. Every dragon seemingly disappears from the world, all at once, even continents away from the calamity in Cthene. No dragon has been seen since.

## The Mourning Age
Thus dawned the Mourning Age, which brought the discovery of _arcanathyst_. This mystical mineral led to technological breakthroughs unprecedented by prior civilization. Mortals attain a mastery of magic heretofore unimaginable.

## The Broken Age
The current Age, just 35 years old, has been heralded as the Broken Age by the Chroniclers of N'er. It remains to be seen what signs and portents will be born out from the Age to come.
