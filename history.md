# History

There are several ways to view the history of Yewdar, depending on one's intent. One is that of the deep chronicler, seeing the whole of history. For that, it is helpful to learn about the Ages of Yewdar. Another is that of the anthropologist, studying Yewdar's kiths and their unique cultures and histories. Maybe you're interested in how the kiths themselves count time? Or perhaps you're more a student of religion, and would like to know about the deities that watch over Yewdar. Maybe you want to hear about the dragons which once were and now are gone.

In addition to these topics are dedicated sections for various important events, like the founding of Laurentia and Apex City and the No-Sun Crisis.

## Apex City and Laurentia
The dawn of the Mourning Age brought about the disappearance of the dragons, the founding of the kingdom of Kulturia, and an era of human expansionism across the continent of Osenia.

To the east of Kulturia, over the mountains, lay the great Laurentian Plain. It was a huge expanse of territory that had gone unclaimed by any nation since the Black Age. The dragons patrolled this area and suffered only few settlements there…

With the dragons' departure and a young, triumphant nation of Osan peoples eager to grow their holdings, it was not long before expeditions were sent over the dwarf holds and onto the plains.

The plain was deceptively hospitable.

The weather on the Laurentian Plains was capricious, and while the native grasses grew in abundance it was found to be very difficult to get foodstuff crops to bear anything but the most meager harvest.

The halfling explorer Reis the Wanderer was the one who found the large stone mesa formation that she would name Apex for its immense size and height. It became a waypoint for travelers and used for navigation by settlers of the region.

It wasn't long until the plains were de facto Kulturian territory, if not de jure.

As a town began to spring up around the Apex mesa, curious prospectors began to poke at the formation itself to see if it held any value other than its size and relative centrality on the plain.

The prospectors at Apex found a number of useful metal ores within the mesa of unusual purity. There were also unusual veins of a quartz-like gemstone that glowed purple in the presence of magical energy.

This stone would later become known as arcanathyst.

A series of discoveries on the nature of arcanathyst quickly followed. The stone could store magical energy like a battery, and be used to create new effects that contemporary arcane understanding had not previously achieved, like apparent-mass manipulation.

The discovery of arcanathyst would have been reason enough for Apex to draw attention, but the finding that the mesa was an enormous storehouse of the mineral was the spark for a enormous boom in settlement and investment.
Before long, Apex was the largest city on the continent. Powered by the new magical technologies afforded by arcanathyst, the city grew from the plain onto the mesa itself, with huge towers thrusting into the sky like great needles of stone, metal and glass.

Kulturia created a full province out of the plain called Laurentia, with Apex City as its seat and appointed a royal governor instead of granting the new province its own hereditary ruler. Politics, you understand…

Apex City became a very business-heavy city, with mining interests playing a predominant role, followed by the nascent airship industry and the trading houses that would bring arcanathyst to market and fill the airships with cargo.

After the [No-Sun Crisis](#the-no-sun-crisis) of the late Mourning Age, Apex City was a metropolis in recovery. The Breach had torn a hole in a mesa hundreds of meters wide, and collapsed towers that destroyed whole neighborhoods, warehouses, and other assets.

The Kulturian throne was very slow to render aid to the stricken city, concerned as it was with urgent issues closer to home. Desperation for help gave way to anger among the citizenry, and ultimately the local corporations opened their purses for rebuilding efforts.

The pervading sense that the citizens of Laurentia were on their own in a crisis, compounded by corporate desires to be free from Kulturian taxation and oversight, ratcheted up tensions between the city and its governor. The Kulturian responses were ham-fisted and had **bad** optics.

By the year 10 Broken, things had reached a boiling point. The corporations of Apex City prepared to declare themselves independent of Kulturia, and had manufactured legions of advanced golems to defend their claims should the Kulturian Crown decide to force the matter.

Predictably, the Kulturian military mobilized. The Apex militia of 200,000 soldiers and 55,000 golems took the field to stop them from crossing the mountains near Grinef's Gap.

Unpredictably, on the eve of battle, the Kulturians withdrew.

The then-king Azorian VII could not bear to turn Osan brothers and sisters against each other, and sent an embassy to the leaders of the rebellion to recognize them as their own sovereign state.

What would be known as the Bloodless War was over and the nation of Laurentia born.

Today, Laurentia is a bustling, prosperous mercantile oligarchy… with all the good and bad that comes with it. Its arcanathyst exports make it the wealthiest and most influential nation, and its airship militia is warily regarded as the mightiest afloat.

The Laurentian golem legions would attain sentience due to the designs of their unwilling creator, Bramwell Payne. The new artificial lifeforms are known as the Talosan, and in 25 years have become fully integrated into Laurentian society.

Laurentia is currently at war with the orcish clans of Hol Khozet to the south… a war that is but a week old and has a dubious casus belli. It remains to be seen how the war will unfold, and what the shape of the continent will be when the smoke clears.

## The No-Sun Crisis

Yentis University archeo-artificer Malvern Drech discovered the ruins of a titanic machine beneath a mining claim in Apex City. It was unspeakably old and strange… almost alien…

After his discovery, he heard voices speaking to him… voices that made him question his sanity, but that also revealed secrets about the machine… and compelled him to rebuild it.

When his University colleagues rejected his plans, he started desperately looking for ways to get his own money and resources. He sold magical items of his own making, and more than a few from the University vaults.
His dismissal came soon thereafter.

Drech fell in with a crime syndicate known as the League of the Silent. His plans deterred, he accumulated influence within the organization until he was highly placed and could repurpose their thievery and murder to his own ends.

The League scoured the city and the continent for power sources, rare metals, and hidden magics to power the dread machine.

Despite adventurers on their heels, they succeeded…

The machine was the drive core of an antediluvian construct known as the No-Sun, the flying daemonic fortress that brought about the literal darkness of the Black Age.

As Drech brought it shuddering back to life, the machine broke through the mesa of Apex City…

The adventuring band who attempted to thwart Drech’s plans boarded the machine, slew Drech and the daemon that possessed him, and destroyed the old device utterly.
