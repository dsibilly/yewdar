# History

There are several ways to view the history of Yewdar, depending on one's intent. One is that of the deep chronicler, seeing the whole of history. For that, it is helpful to learn about the Ages of Yewdar. Another is that of the anthropologist, studying Yewdar's kiths and their unique cultures and histories. Maybe you're interested in how the kiths themselves count time? Or perhaps you're more a student of religion, and would like to know about the deities that watch over Yewdar. Maybe you want to hear about the dragons which once were and now are gone.
