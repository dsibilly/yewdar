# Races

Yewdar is home to many races of sentient beings. Some of them are native to the world, seeded there by the gods or evolved forms of indigenous fauna. Other races are visitors or refugees from other planes who have made Yewdar their new home. Yet more are artificial life, created by powerful progenitors for purposes known and unknown.

There are a total of eight playable races in the Yewdar campaign setting:

* Humans
* Elves
* Dwarves
* Gnomes
* Halflings
* Orcs
* Drakon
* Talosan

There are other races, sentient and otherwise, but are reserved for use by Game Masters populating the setting; consult with your Game Master before selecting a race not detailed in this book.
