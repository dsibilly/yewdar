# Magic and Technology in Yewdar

Yewdar is a fantastical place, and the line between [magic](#magic) and [technology](#technology) is really a matter of personal preference. However you decide to view it, the following sections will tell you the basics of what you need to know about it.

## Magic

Scholars conjecture that certain individuals have an innate ability to sense and/or interact with what they call the "manatonic field," a paracausal aura the permeates all points in space and time. Individuals that can interact with the manatonic field typically exhibit a reservoir of manatonic potential energy, or MP. Expenditure of such MP permits beings to selectively excite the local field to bring about a variety of effects that seem to violate causality…

The majority of magical effects have been categorized into discrete arcana: related groups of rituals that share a common characteristic, such as healing, manipulation of water, etc. There are nineteen distinct arcana according to current research. The 19 arcana are Air, Beast, Cold, Death, Divination, Earth, Enchantment, Fate, Fire, Healing, Heroic, Illusion, Lightning, Power, Protection, Psychic, Shadow, Water, and Wood. There are also a number of fairly trivial effects that lie outside the formal arcana. These minor applications of magic are collectively known as the minor arcana, and include such simple spells as generating light or divining North. 

### Necromancy

Yewdar has a strange relationship with Necromancy. Abasys, goddess of death, does not permit the souls of the departed to return to Yewdar… so while mindless undead exist, the intelligent entities like vampires do not. So if you run into an undead creature with intelligence, there is *something else* at work. Something *worse* than just a restless soul playing hooky from the Endless Halls, the plane of the afterlife.

### Arcanathyst

Arcanathyst is a rare ore mineral unique to Yewdar. When refined and extracted via hot acid solution, it can be crystallized to form gemstones with unique magical properties. The most readily recognizable property of refined arcanathyst is its ability to store magical potential energy, like a battery. This capability can free a caster from the time-based regeneration of their own MP reserves. Once refined and crystallized, arcanathyst has applications in various shapes and sizes, from large crystals to ground dust. It enables things like speaking stones, glow rods, airship flying keels, and batteries to power devices that rely on magic to function.

## Technology

Mastery of magic has brought about a number of technological innovations usually associated with the rise of steam and gunpowder on Earth. Long distance communications, arcane street lamps, and airships are commonplace.

## Arcane Blasters

The arcane blaster is a portable ranged weapon akin to a flintlock firearm. Powered by charged arcanathyst crystals, it fires coherent bolts of force instead of physical projectiles. A blaster's firing assembly uses a small, built-in arcanathyst crystal to introduce an overcharge state to the crystal used as the device's "magazine." This causes a release of energy that is channeled and directed by the blaster toward a target. Larger blaster-based weapons have collimator chambers that focus energy into smaller, faster bolts that can either increase effective range (bolts will dissipate over time and distance) or power.

## Airships

The airship is a heavier-than-air conveyance that uses arcanathyst as a mass nullifier, allowing the vessel to float in the air. The first airships were created in the last century of the Mourning Age. The foundational element of an airship is the flying keel, a hand-made structure made from strong, lightweight woods. Ground arcanathyst dust is mixed with resin and inlaid into mortised channels in the keel. The patterns of the mortises are exacting and intricate. Early airships were derived heavily from existing seagoing vessels, complete with sails and masts. Most could land in the water and pull up to a dock like any other ship. As the magical and technological practices evolved, so too did airship design. They lost the ability to land in water when hulls stopped being so heavily sealed, but also lost significant weight. Horizontal & diagonal masts made better use of winds in three dimensions. Modern airships, made in the last 50 years (i.e., ones in the Broken Age), have dispensed with masts and sails altogether. The same mass well manipulation that enables the flying keel has been miniaturized and is integrated into active control surfaces that provide both propulsion and 3-axis steerage.
