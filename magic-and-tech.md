# Magic and Technology in Yewdar

Yewdar is a fantastical place, and the line between [magic](#magic) and [technology](#technology) is really a matter of personal preference. However you decide to view it, the following sections will tell you the basics of what you need to know about it.

## Magic

Scholars conjecture that certain individuals have an innate ability to sense and/or interact with what they call the "manatonic field," a paracausal aura the permeates all points in space and time. Individuals that can interact with the manatonic field typically exhibit a reservoir of manatonic potential energy, or MP. Expenditure of such MP permits beings to selectively excite the local field to bring about a variety of effects that seem to violate causality…

The majority of magical effects have been categorized into discrete arcana: related groups of rituals that share a common characteristic, such as healing, manipulation of water, etc. There are twenty distinct arcana according to current research. The 19 arcana are Air, Beast, Cold, Death, Divination, Dream, Earth, Enchantment, Fate, Fire, Healing, Heroic, Illusion, Lightning, Power, Protection, Psychic, Shadow, Water, and Wood. There are also a number of fairly trivial effects that lie outside the formal arcana. These minor applications of magic are collectively known as the minor arcana, and include such simple spells as generating light or divining North.

### Necromancy

Yewdar has a strange relationship with Necromancy. Abasys, goddess of death, does not permit the souls of the departed to return to Yewdar… so while mindless undead exist, the intelligent entities like vampires do not. So if you run into an undead creature with intelligence, there is *something else* at work. Something *worse* than just a restless soul playing hooky from the Endless Halls, the plane of the afterlife.

### Arcanathyst

Arcanathyst is a rare ore mineral unique to Yewdar. When refined and extracted via hot acid solution, it can be crystallized to form gemstones with unique magical properties. The most readily recognizable property of refined arcanathyst is its ability to store magical potential energy, like a battery. This capability can free a caster from the time-based regeneration of their own MP reserves. Once refined and crystallized, arcanathyst has applications in various shapes and sizes, from large crystals to ground dust. It enables things like speaking stones, glow rods, airship flying keels, and batteries to power devices that rely on magic to function.

### New Arcana: Dream

Your magic draws upon Vakaré, the Realm of Dreams, to weave the dreams of yourself and others into reality.

## Dream Catcher (Novice)

**Requirements:** Dream Arcana (Novice)
**Casting Time:** Major Action
**MP Cost:** 3
**Target Number:** 12

You have learned to craft a tiny arcane totem from sticks and twine and feathers that protects creatures near it. When you cast the spell, the dream catcher grants creatures within 6 yards a +1 to tests against magical effects. This dream catcher persists for a number of rounds equal to the caster’s Willpower before dissipating into ethereal bubbles.
You may only have one dream catcher at a time; if you create a new dream catcher, the last one you created vanishes.

## Fleeting Condition (Novice)

**Requirements:** Dream Arcana (Novice)
**Casting Time:** Major Action
**MP Cost:** 3
**Target Number:** 11

Dream-like clouds curl from your fingertips toward a creature you can see within 20 yards, surrounding it. The target must succeed a Willpower (Self-Discipline) test against your Spellpower or suffer one of the following random conditions (roll 1d6) until the end of its next turn:
- Blinded
- Deafened
- Frightened
- Slowed
- Stunned
- Confused

## Dreamcraft (Novice)

**Requirements:** Dream Arcana (Novice)
**Casting Time:** Major Action
**MP Cost:** 4
**Target Number:** 10

Pulling upon the magical essence of Vakaré, you create one or more of the following effects at a point of your choosing within 10 yards:
- A harmless auditory effect within range such as crickets, chirping, snoring, or white noise.
- A general sense of drowsiness that affects creatures at the target point.
- A surreal mist that lightly obscures the area. Creatures within this mist gain a +1 to Dexterity (Stealth) tests and gain Concealment (-1 to attacks against them.)
- Everything within 10 yards of you loses its color and can only be seen in black and white.
- The effect lasts for up to 1 hour, or when the caster ends the spell as a free action.

## Perspectives (Novice)

**Requirements:** Dream Arcana (Novice)
**Casting Time:** Minor Action
**MP Cost:** 4
**Target Number:** 11

When you cast this spell, you can gain information from several vantage points simultaneously. For a number of rounds equal to your Willpower, you gain a +2 on Communication (Investigation) and Perception (Searching) tests. Additionally, you cannot be surprised for the duration of the spell.

## Oneironautics (Expert)

**Requirements:** Dream Arcana (Expert)
**Casting Time:** Major Action
**MP Cost:** 8
**Target Number:** 13

You create a two-way dream filament between yourself and a target creature you touch. Unwilling creatures may resist this spell by succeeding a Willpower (Self-Discipline) test against the caster’s Spellpower. For a number of rounds equal to the caster’s Willpower, at the end of each of the target’s turns, you may teleport to an unoccupied space within 2 yards of it. The target of the spell can do the same at the end of the caster’s turn as well. These teleportations may occur only once per round each. You may end this spell as a free action.

**Target Number:** 15

You cancel the senses of a foe by filling their mind with nightmares. Choose one creature that you can see within 20 yards.

- You understand any spoken language that you hear.
- You have +2 to Willpower (Courage) and Willpower (Self-Discipline).

This spell lasts a number of rounds equal to your Spellpower.

## Technology

Mastery of magic has brought about a number of technological innovations usually associated with the rise of steam and gunpowder on Earth. Long distance communications, arcane street lamps, and airships are commonplace.

## Arcane Blasters

The arcane blaster is a portable ranged weapon akin to a flintlock firearm. Powered by charged arcanathyst crystals, it fires coherent bolts of force instead of physical projectiles. A blaster's firing assembly uses a small, built-in arcanathyst crystal to introduce an overcharge state to the crystal used as the device's "magazine." This causes a release of energy that is channeled and directed by the blaster toward a target. Larger blaster-based weapons have collimator chambers that focus energy into smaller, faster bolts that can either increase effective range (bolts will dissipate over time and distance) or power.

## Airships

The airship is a heavier-than-air conveyance that uses arcanathyst as a mass nullifier, allowing the vessel to float in the air. The first airships were created in the last century of the Mourning Age. The foundational element of an airship is the flying keel, a hand-made structure made from strong, lightweight woods. Ground arcanathyst dust is mixed with resin and inlaid into mortised channels in the keel. The patterns of the mortises are exacting and intricate. Early airships were derived heavily from existing seagoing vessels, complete with sails and masts. Most could land in the water and pull up to a dock like any other ship. As the magical and technological practices evolved, so too did airship design. They lost the ability to land in water when hulls stopped being so heavily sealed, but also lost significant weight. Horizontal & diagonal masts made better use of winds in three dimensions. Modern airships, made in the last 50 years (i.e., ones in the Broken Age), have dispensed with masts and sails altogether. The same mass well manipulation that enables the flying keel has been miniaturized and is integrated into active control surfaces that provide both propulsion and 3-axis steerage.
