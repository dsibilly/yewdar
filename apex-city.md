## A Visitor's Guide

Apex, the largest city on the continent of Osenia and a defining location in the nation of Laurentia, looms atop a high, broad mesa near the heart of the Laurentian Plains. The City of Flight rises high above the plain below, growing upward within the limited space available on the plateau.

Deep chasms delved by the original miners of the mesa separate the city into four distinct regions: Reis' Landing to the west, Drakesdown on the east, Tasma Plateau to the north, and Southington to the south. A fifth district, Meridian, lies below the many mining tunnels dug into the cliffsides and rings the rest of the city. Above the city's highest towers and temples, the Liaran Shipyards float. Apex City also extends underground into sewers and long-forgotten ruins, and deeper still into the mines and tunnels of Nadir.

Apex sits atop the largest known natural deposits of arcanathyst in Osenia. This rich natural resource enhances magic related to flying and levitation, which makes many of Apex's magical wonders possible. The vast majority of magic items used within the city to facilitate flight only function because of arcanathyst

Most of Apex's neighborhoods are stratified vertically. For example, while Southington is known as a center of entertainment, the type and quality of entertainment available varies among the different levels of towers. The upper levels (usually referred to as “Upper Southington”) offer high art in the form of opera, theatre, and symphony, as well as housing Yentis University and a thriving community of writers and other creative types. The middle levels (“Middle Southington”) house a thriving theatre district with more affordable shows, a large number of professional minstrels, acrobats, and similar entertainers, and a year-round circus complete with animals. The lower levels (“Lower Southington”) contain a very different sort of theatre district marked by burlesque shows, a red-light district, and a great number of taverns for cheap and bawdy entertainment.

A long wall rings **Drakesdown** at its lowest level, interrupted by towers along its entire length. Inside the wall, structures rise toward the tallest towers near the middle, creating a great artificial mountain above the plains on the eastern edge of the city. Mostly populated by the upper and middle classes, Drakesdown houses the seat of the city's government, its wealthiest citizens, and its finest businesses. Embassies from other nations, important representatives of powerful trading guilds, and banks are found here as well.

**Southington** serves as the entertainment hub of the city, and is home to Yentis University and a variegated quilt of different kith. Certainly the most trendy of Apex's districts, Southington is a popular tourist destination. No walls surround Southington, though its tallest towers are spread among the outer rim. The enormous dome of Yentis University, ringed by five tall, slender towers, stands near the center of the plateau.

**Tasma Plateau**, the most residential of Apex's districts, contains everything from towertop penthouses in the heights to tightly packed tenements on the lower levels. Aside from a marketplace district on the ground level, Tasma is a quiet neighborhood with little commerce and little crime.

**Reis' Landing**, at the western edge of the city, is notable for being the eastern terminus of the Great Osenian Highroad and the official gateway to Apex. The lower levels cater to traders and travelers entering Apex by both land and air, and include an entire city district that has been converted to provide housing for refugees of the Eladar Fleet. The middle levels are broader in their purposes, including a variety of trades, services, and residential districts. Crowning the towers of the Landing are the Apex Skydocks, a waypoint for nearly all air travel and trade on the continent. The businesses of the Upper Landing are either directly related to shipping or cater to airship crews, adventurers, and other transients.

**Meridian** is the largest district of Apex, ringing the high plateau of the city like a collar. It is also the poorest, with even the most well-off residents solidly middle-class. Meridian mixes various businesses and housing, never approaching a true residential district, but holding a number of apartments, tenements, and slums. Some of the poorest miners have even built shantytowns in caves dug into the Apex cliffsides.

**The Liaran Shipyards**, called simply Liara by most of Apex's citizens, are magically suspended above the city using vast stone slabs enchanted with arcanathyst. Over half of the floating platform is dominated by warehouses, shipyards, and other facilities dedicated to the construction of airships. Many homes belonging to members of the Shipwright's Guild can be found here, giving Liara a high concentration of wealth and prestige. Some of Apex's finest inns and restaurants—as well as exotic and upscale trades—can be found here.

**Nadir** is the beating heart of Apex, full of mines and caverns, foundries and forges that turn the valuable ores beneath the city into the products that bring it prosperity. Much of the wealth beneath Apex is from vast deposits of arcanathyst crystal, but there are also veins of iron and mithril that make conventional mining and smelting a popular business venture. Occassionally a mining expedition might even uncover natural caverns or ancient ruins buried by the passing of centuries.

## What Brings You to Apex?

The sheer size of the city, the maze of bridges among the towers, and the bewildering array of goods and services available can quickly overwhelm first-time visitors to Apex. Adventurers usually come to the city with a specific purpose in mind, to get one thing done. Whether it's to sell a magic item or spend an enjoyable evening (and a good portion of loot from their last adventure) out on the town, adventurers in a hurry need to know where to go to get what they need, or they could spent a lot of time wandering the maze that is the Jewel of the Plains.

### Antiquities
Whether characters are interested in viewing scholarly exhibits of the latest finds from Ikaemo or selling the items they find there themselves, Upper Southington is the neighborhood to visit. Yentis University's Dorian Museum of Antiquities houses the finest collection of Ikaemin artifacts in the world. The uppermost level of Khorius Tower near the museum (in the Seventh Tower district) is sometimes called “Little Ikaemo,” thanks to the six competing dealers in antiquities that share the tower space.

### Banking
Characters bringing large amounts of valuable treasure from their latest adventure can find the banking services they need in the Upper Drakesdown ward. The dwarven House Axforge operates the largest bank in the city, the Axforge Bank of Apex, located at the top of Beryl Tower. The Gellidus district of Upper Drakesdown features nine other banks, as well as a number of moneychangers, lenders, and providers of other financial services.

### Setting up Shop
Characters may wish to purchase a business or other space in the city. A poor shop (for trades or services) costs 2d6x100 silver, including rough shelves, a sales counter, and a back room for storage. An average shop costs 2d6x1000 silver, including polished wood floors, handsome shelves, a picture window, and glass cases. An upscale shop costs 4d6x1000 silver and has marble floors, locked display cases, leather chairs, and various other luxuries.

### Communication
Apex is a center for international trade, and communication is the lifeblood of commerce &mdash; not to mention being an important commodity in its own right.

The Speaker's Guild specializes in swift communication. The most economical form of communication is the speaking stone. The Speaker's Guild has established message stations in most of the major cities and towns of Osenia, and for 15 sp you can send a one-page message to any of these stations. If you are sending a message to a large city, you can pay an additional 15 sp to have your message delivered to a specific address in the city; otherwise, the recipient must come to the message station to pick up the message.

Apex contains a number of message stations, as merchants and tradesfolk often use them to send messages within the city. The largest such station is located in Sharptooth Tower in Upper Drakesdown. This is the only place where a message can be sent via psychic contact, though this service is often unavailable. The reason for this depends on who you ask, and you're just as likely to hear utter hogwash as you are to hear something plausible.

If a character is in a desperate hurry, they can press a Guild Speaker to use the whispering wind spell to relay a message to the nearest message station. Each Speaker has a three word identification code that must be included in the message to track payment, so the contents of the message are limited to twenty-two words. This service usually costs 100 sp, on top of the cost of using the message station.

Courier services are provided by the Sons of Meno, who have three stations within the city. The cost to deliver a message or small package varies by the talents of the courier, as does the speed at which the message is delivered. A courier with the ability to shadow slip can often speed up delivery by teleporting across bridges and between tower levels.

The Sons of Meno also maintain a mail service that runs through all major cities and towns along the Great Osenian Highroad. It costs 1/2 sp per mile to send a message through the mail. However, mail sent in this manner is held at the Sons of Meno enclave at the destination. If the customer wants a message or parcel to be delivered to a specific address, he must add the usual courier costs to the price of the mail transport.

Competing with the Sons of Meno for the courier trade are the agents of the Skymail, a successful venture by former shipwright Palleon Arendis and based in a converted warehouse in Liara. He started years ago with a small but highly effective fleet of speedy skyhook vehicles, one-man miniature flying carriages. The Skymail charges 5 sp to have their daring skyhook pilots deliver a letter or small package anywhere within Apex, with an additional charge of 5 sp per mile outside the city. The Sons of Meno have a capacity and availability advantage, however: there are only thirty skyhooks in service, compared to one hundred twenty Sons of Meno couriers.

### Companionship
Few people enjoy being alone in an unfamiliar city. Apex offers a number of opportunities to find companionship, from paying for company to attending social clubs, guilds, and other places to meet people with similar interests.

Apex's several red-light districts sell sex and companionship on the cheap, catering primarily to sailors, merchants, tourists, and other transients or outsiders. Apex's Welcome, in Nadir, caters to traveling customers but is crime-ridden and dangerous. Dragoneyes, in Lower Reis' Landing, is slightly more reputable. Firelight, in the lower part of the entertainment hub of Southington, has a reputation as an amenable location for an all-around good time.

Subtler and far classier, a handful of escort services sell companionship at much higher rates in Middle Drakesdown's embassy district, Ambassador Towers. Though they target wealthy diplomats who need educated, intelligent companions for public functions as well as private encounters, these services have customers in all of the wealthier neighborhoods of the city and attract well-off adventurers, merchants, and others with more discerning tastes in companionship.

Companionship of a less carnal nature can be found as well. Adventurers might well find adventuring companions in Blue Hawk (in Upper Reis' Landing) or Deathsgate (in Meridian). Each features a guild of adventurers named after the district, and the two guilds have an ongoing rivalry that swings between friendly and violent. True to its name, the Deathsgate Guild tends to attract more violent, freewheeling adventurers, while the Band of the Blue Hawk generally attracts people with more of a moral compass. Both guilds provide a fine source of adventuring companions and cohorts, and refer their members to other services and hirelings as well.

Dining clubs provide a popular form of social circle, particularly in upper-class neighborhoods. A large number of such clubs flourish in Upper and Middle Drakesdown, Upper Southington, Upper Reis' Landing, Upper Tasma Plateau, and the Liaran Shipyards. Dining clubs are open to members only, offering a fine dining experience among an intimate circle of social peers.

Finally, characters can always find others who share their specific interests. Social groups based on kith, ethnicity, or region exist in almost every neighborhood; trade and craft guilds offer social contact for their members; and Yentis University hosts academic societies with a wide variety of interests and specialties.

## City Architecture
Apex consists of a number of common elements that take on amazing proportions within the city's dizzying heights.

### Towers
The towers of Apex range in height from 30 meters to nearly a _mile_ tall. Their basic construction is that of a traditional stone building, though. Extensive magics go into their construction, from the spells used to lift blocks of stone to such enormous heights to the magic that strengthens and supports the towers, allowing them to stand despite all probability. Even with such magic in place, the towers tend to be broad at the bottom and narrow at the top. Several towers are topped with elegant spires or domes, while others are crowned with flat platforms that hold parks, pools, estates, or even stadiums. The surface of the plateau has been swallowed up as towers were built upward and lower walls thickened to the point that many towers have merged their foundations, becoming a solid maze of walls intersecting with no observable pattern.

Most towers are roughly 250 to 750 meters in diameter at the bottom, narrowing to 60 to just under 200 meters at the top. Some have narrower spires extending farther upward.

Every tower is built of magically reinforced stone. Generally towers have one story per 3-4 meters of height. Ceilings tend to be lower (and stories packed closer together) at lower levels and higher toward the top levels, but there are exceptions (e.g., warehouse towers usually have universally high ceilings.) Stories might also be subdivided: popular residential designs feature an open courtyard, 6 meters or more in height, surrounded by two-story homes built as if hanging off the wall of the tower. Most towers are studded with balconies, riddled with windows, and connected to neighboring towers with bridges.

### Balconies
Balconies range from simple ledges with guardrails where a homeowner can step outside to enjoy the view, to large platforms where skycarriages can land to discharge passengers. Most towers have at least one balcony per story; many have more, at least at certain levels. Flying is so prevalent in the city that any balcony is a potential entry-point to a tower. Balconies opening into businesses or residences can be secured by some means, ranging from a simple door or portcullis to magical means. A large number of balconies, especially the larger ones, open into public space.

### Streets
Streets run through the towers of Apex, allowing horses, mules, and wagons to travel in a fairly normal fashion within the city. Unlike the streets of a typical city, most of those streets are broad boulevards instead of twisting alleyways, either suspended high above the ground, arcing around towers, or constructed through the center of a tower or other building.

Because the streets of Apex are almost entirely indoors, most are artificially lit with arcanathyst torches or glow rods. The upper levels of the city tend to have the best lighting, while torches in Nadir are spaced so far apart as to leave large swathes of darkness.

### Bridges
Most bridges connect the streets running through the towers, allowing wagons and pedestrians to cross from one spire to the next. They are generally as wide as the streets. Low walls along the edges of bridges prevent people from falling accidentally. Major bridges can be as wide as 15 meters across, and may have structures build into their edges, crowding the roadway down to 3-4 meters. Such bridges are popular sites for street faires and bazaars.

Many narrower bridges span the gaps between towers as well, not designed for carrying vehicle traffic but for pedestrian passage. These bridges are 2-4 meters wide and almost always have low walls or railings.

### Lifts
One of the most important uses of magic in Apex is the creation of magic lifts to allow vertical travel between levels of towers. Particularly at lower levels, ramps wind around the inside and outside of large towers to get wagons from level to level. However, at higher levels specially designed levitation devices carry passengers and cargo up and down within the towers.

### Falling
Falling from potentially deadly heights presents a constant danger in Apex City. Whether a character is pushed over the side of a bridge, knocked from a skycarriage, or thrown off a balcony, the sudden stop far below can have deadly consequences. Fortunately, Apex has precautions in place to reduce the number of deaths that result from falls.

The city guard offers a standard reward of 100 silver to any spellcaster who casts _wind net_ on a falling person. The reward is large enough, and the risk of falling high enough, that spellcasters who have access to the Wind Arcana almost always learn _wind net_. Watch patrols usually carry a _wand of wind net_, but few members of the city guard have sufficient practice to use it well.

Bridges in the Upper and Middle levels are also warded with permanent _wind net_ effects to protect those using them from falling bodies and other large objects. Such wards are triggered automatically when an object comes within 10 meters of the top or sides of a bridge.

A popular magic item among those that can afford one is a _wind net talisman_, a single-use item containing a _wind net_.

## Getting Where You're Going
Travel in Apex can be unpredictable. Residents joke that it takes about an hour to get anywhere, whether it's just down three levels in the same tower or all the way across town. Of course, skycarriages reduce the time dramatically compared to walking from place to place, and characters who really know their way around (as well as characters who are willing to ask for directions frequently along the way) can get to their destinations more quickly than newcomers who refuse to display their ignorance.

If it becomes important to know how long it takes to get from one place to another, use the following rules of thumb:

### Foot Travel

|  Destination  |  Travel Time  |
| :------------ | ------------: |
| Same Ward |  3d6 minutes  |
| Same District     |  6d6 minutes  |
| Adjacent District | 3d6x5 minutes |
| Farther than Adjacent District | 6d6x5 minutes |

### Flying Travel

| Destination | Travel Time |
| :---------- | ----------: |
| Same Ward | 1d6 minutes |
| Same District | 2d6 minutes |
| Adjacent District | 1d6x5 minutes |
| Farther than Adjacent District | 2d6x5 minutes |

A party can reduce their travel time by half if one character makes a successful TN 13 Intelligence (Navigation) or Communication (Investigation) test.
