# Apex: Jewel of Laurentia

## A Visitor's Guide

Apex, the largest city on the continent of Osenia and one of the defining locations in the nation of Laurentia, looms atop a high, broad mesa near the heart of the Laurentian Plains. The City of Flight rises high above the plain below, growing upward within the limited space available on the plateau. Deep chasms delved by the original miners of the mesa separate the city into four distinct regions: Reis' Landing to the west, Drakesdown on the east, Tasma Plateau to the north, and Southington to the south. Below the many mining tunnels dug into the cliffsides, the district of Meridian rings the city. Above the highest towers and temples, the Liaran Shipyards float over the city. The city also extends underground, into sewers and long-forgotten ruins, and deeper to the mines and tunnels of Nadir.

Apex sits atop the largest known natural deposits of arcanathyst in Osenia. This rich natural resource enhances magic related to flying and levitation, which makes many of Apex's magical wonders possible. The vast majority of magic items used within the city to facilitate flight only function because of arcanathyst.

Most of Apex's neighborhoods are vertically stratified. For example, while Southington is known as a center of entertainment, the type and quality of entertainment available varies among the different levels of towers. The upper levels (usually referred to as “Upper Southington”) offer high art in the form of opera, theatre, and symphony, as well as housing Yentis University and a thriving community of writers and other artists. The middle levels (“Middle Southington”) house a thriving theatre district with more affordable shows, a large number of professional minstrels, acrobats, and similar entertainers, and a year-round circus complete with animals. The lower levels (“Lower Southington”) contain a very different sort of theatre district marked by burlesque shows, a red light district, and a great number of taverns for cheap and bawdy entertainment.

A long wall rings ***Drakesdown*** at its lowest level, interrupted by towers along its entire length. Inside the wall, structures rise higher and higher toward the tallest towers near the middle, creating a great artificial mountain above the plains on the eastern edge of the city. Mostly populated by the upper and middle classes, Drakesdown houses the seat of the city's government, its wealthiest citizens, and its finest businesses. Embassies from other nations, important representatives of powerful trading guilds, and banks are found here as well.

***Southington*** serves as the entertainment hub of the city, and is home to Yentis University and a variegated quilt of different races. Certainly the most trendy of Apex's districts, Southington is a popular tourist destination. No walls surround Southington, though its tallest towers are spread among the outer rim. The enormous dome of *Yentis University*, ringed by five tall, slender towers, stands near the center of the plateau.

***Tasma Plateau***, the most residential of Apex's districts, contains everything from towertop penthouses in the heights to tightly packed tenements on the lower levels. Aside from a marketplace district on the ground level, Tasma is a quiet neighborhood with little commerce and little crime.

***Reis' Landing*** at the western edge of the city is in some ways defined by being eastern terminus of the Great Osenian Highroad and the official gateway to Apex. The lower levels cater to traders and travelers entering Apex by both land and air, and include an entire city district that has been converted to provide housing for refugees of the Eladar Fleet. The middle levels are broader in their purposes, including a variety of trades, services and residential districts. Crowning the towers of the Landing are the Apex Skydocks, a waypoint for nearly all air travel and trade on the continent. The businesses of the Upper Landing are either directly related to shipping or cater to airship crews, adventurers, and other transients.

***Meridian*** is the largest quarter of Apex, ringing the high plateau of the city like a collar. It is also the poorest, with even the most well-off residents solidly middle-class. Meridian mixes various businesses and housing, never approaching a true residential district but holding a number of apartments, tenements and slums. Some of the poorest miners have even built shantytowns in caves dug into the Apex cliffsides.

***The Liaran Shipyards***, called simply *Liara* by most of Apex's citizens, are magically suspended above the city using vast stone slabs enchanted with arcanathyst. Over half of the floating platform is dominated by warehouses, shipyards and other facilities dedicated to the construction of airships. Many homes belonging to members of the Shipwright's Guild can be found here, giving Liara a high concentration of wealth and prestige. Some of Apex's finest inns and restaurants as well as exotic and upscale trades can be found here.

***Nadir*** is the beating heart of Apex, full of mines and caverns, foundries and forges that turn the valuable ores beneath the city into the products that bring it prosperity. Much of the wealth beneath Apex is from vast deposits of arcanathyst crystal, but there are also veins of iron and mithril that make conventional mining and smelting a popular business venture. Occassionally a mining expedition will uncover natural caverns or ancient ruins buried by the passing of centuries.

## What Brings You to Apex?

The sheer size of the city, the maze of bridges among the towers and the bewildering array of goods and services available can quickly overwhelm first-time visitors to Apex. Adventurers usually come to the city with a specific purpose in mind, to get one thing done. Whether its to sell a magic item or spend an enjoyable evening (and a good portion of loot from their last adventure) out on the town, adventurers in a hurry need to know where to go to get what they need, or they could spent a lot of time wandering the maze that is the Jewel of the Plains.

### Antiquities

Whether characters are interested in viewing scholarly exhibits of the latest finds from Ikaemo or selling the items they find there themselves, Upper Southington is the neighborhood to visit. Yentis University's Dorian Museum of Antiquities houses the finest collection of Ikaemin artifacts in the world. The uppermost level of Khorius Tower near the museum (in the Seventh Tower district) is sometimes called “Little Ikaemo,” thanks to the six competing dealers in antiquities that share the tower space.

### Banking

Characters bringing large amounts of valuable treasure from their latest adventure can find the banking services they need in the Upper Drakesdown ward. The dwarven House Axforge operates the largest bank in the city, the Axforge Bank of Apex, located at the top of Beryl Tower. The Gellidus district of Upper Drakesdown features nine other banks, as well as a number of moneychangers, lenders, and providers of other financial services.

### General Commerce

Characters interested in carrying on trade can visit any of Apex's marketplace districts: Barrion in Middle Drakesdown, North Market in Lower Tasma Plateau, the Bazaar in Meridian, or Reis' Market in Middle Reis' Landing. Merchants must purchase a permit granting them permission to set up a booth or other presence in the marketplace.

Merchants interested in buying goods in bulk for transport and sale in another city will likely find what they need in one of the city's warehouse districts: Cloudgate in Lower Reis' Landing, White Tower in Drakesdown, the Vault in Nadir or Keepsafe in Meridian. Each of these districts serves as a repository for goods coming into Apex via the Great Osenian Highroad or airship freight, and also offers warehouse rentals for local merchants collecting goods to ship.

### Setting up Shop

Characters may wish to purchase a business or other space in the city. A poor shop (for trades or services) costs 2d6x100 silver, including rough shelves, a sales counter, and a back room for storage. An average shop costs 2d6x1000 silver, including polished wood floors, handsome shelves, a picture window, and glass cases. An upscale shop costs 4d6x1000 silver and has marble floors, locked display cases, leather chairs, and various other luxuries.

### Communication

Apex is a center for international trade, and communication is the lifeblood of commerce - not to mention being an important commodity in its own right.

The Speaker's Guild specializes in swift communication. The most economical form of communication is the *speaking stone*. The Speaker's Guild has established message stations in most of the major cities and towns of Osenia, and for 15 sp you can send a one-page message to any of these stations. If you are sending a message to a large city, you can pay an additional 15 sp to have your message delivered to a specific address in the city; otherwise the recipient must come to the message station to pick up the message.

Apex contains a number of message stations, as merchants and tradesfolk often use them to send messages within the city. The largest such station is located in Sharptooth Tower in Upper Drakesdown. This is the only place where a message can be sent via *psychic contact*, though this service is often unavailable.

If a character is in a desperate hurry, they can press a Guild Speaker to use the whispering wind spell to relay a message to the nearest message station. Each Speaker has a three word identification code that must be included in the message to track payment, so the contents of the message are limited to twenty-two words. This service usually costs 100 sp, on top of the cost of using the message station.

Courier services are provided by the Sons of Meno, who have three stations within the city. The cost to deliver a message or small package varies by the talents of the courier, and thus the speed at which the message is delivered. A courier with the ability to *shadow slip* can often speed up delivery by teleporting across bridges and between tower levels.

The Sons of Meno also maintain a mail service that runs through all major cities and towns along the Great Osenian Highroad. It costs 1/2 sp per mile to send a message through the mail. However, mail sent in this manner is held at the Sons of Meno enclave at the destination. If the customer wants a message or parcel to be delivered to a specific address, he must add the usual courier costs to the price of the mail transport.

Competing with the Sons of Meno for the courier trade are the agents of the Skymail, a successful venture by former shipwright Palleon Arendis. He started years ago with a small but highly effective fleet od speedy *skyhook* vehicles, one-man miniature flying carriages. The Skymail charges 5 sp to have their daring skyhook pilots deliver a letter or small package anywhere within Apex, with an additional charge of 5 sp per mile outside the city. The Sons of Meno have a capacity and availability advantage, however: there are only thirty skyhooks in service, compared to one hundred twenty Sons of Meno couriers. The Skymail is based out of a converted warehouse in Liara.

### Companionship

Few people enjoy being alone in an unfamiliar city. Apex offers a number of opportunities to find companionship, from paying for company to attending social clubs, guilds, and other places to meet people with similar interests.

Apex's several red light districts sell sex and companionship on the cheap, catering primarily to sailors, merchants, tourists, and other transients or outsiders. Apex's Welcome, in Nadir, caters to traveling customers but is crime-ridden and dangerous. Dragoneyes, in Lower Reis' Landing, is slightly more reputable. Firelight, in the lower part of the entertainment hub of Southington, has a reputation as an amenable location for an all-around good time.

Subtler and far classier, a handful of escort services sell companionship at much higher rates in Middle Drakesdown's embassy district, Ambassador Towers. Though they target wealthy diplomats who need educated, intelligent companions for public functions as well as private encounters, these services have customers in all of the wealthier neighborhoods of the city and attract well-off adventurers, merchants, and others with more discerning tastes in companionship.

Companionship of a less carnal nature can be found as well. Adventurers might well find adventuring companions in Blue Hawk (in Upper Reis' Landing) or Deathsgate (in Meridian), to city districts that cater to the adventuring crowd. Each features a guild of adventurers named after the district, and the two guilds have an ongoing rivalry that swings between friendly and violent. True to its name, the Deathsgate Guild tends to attract more violent, freewheeling adventurers, while the Band of the Blue Hawk generally attracts people with more of a moral compass. Both guilds provide a fine source of adventuring companions and cohorts, and refer their members to other services and hirelings as well.

Dining clubs provide a popular form of social circle, particularly in upper-class neighborhoods. A large number of such clubs flourish in Upper and Middle Drakesdown, Upper Southington, Upper Reis' Landing, Upper Trasma's Plateau, and the Liaran Shipyards. Dining clubs are open to members only, offering a fine dining experience among an intimate circle of social peers.

Finally, character can always find others who share their specific interests. Social groups based on racial, ethnic, or national origin exist in almost every neighborhood, trade and craft guilds offer social contact for their members, and Yentis University hosts academic societies witha wide variety of interests and specialties.
