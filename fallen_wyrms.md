# The Fallen Wyrms

## Corridar – The Keeper

Corridar, The Keeper, is the Corrupted Drake of Pride and Despair. He was a devoted cleric of Meno in his draconic life, studious and erudite. While not the first among the four to embrace the lure of Entropy, he became its most outspoken proponent. Now, he is a subtle and deviously powerful force of chaos when he directs his gaze to Yewdar. His plans and machinations span centuries, for time has no meaning in the primordial chaos of Entropius. He has an unknown number of mortal followers, as they are the secret keepers and the hidden movers of the world. His most influential disciples are those who have learned secrets that unravel the edges of sanity: his Dread Edictors, the conduits of his will and eyes upon Yewdar.

## Kementh – The Shadow

Kementh, The Shadow, is the Corrupted Drake of Sloth and Lust. She was the mate of Corridar in life, and while she was not a priest she was a devout follower of Vor. In her corrupted form, she is a mass of ever-shifting shadow draconic in form but never resolving into a static shape. She delights in despoiling both minds and lives among mortals, leading folk to ruin through amplifying their intense and unrelenting desires… or cultivating complete and utter apathy. She has followers in every strata of civilization, but none moreso than the trades that exploit and satiate the basest of desires. She is present in the brothels' ecstacy, in the secret liquor still, in the buzz of inebriation, and in the unthinking passionate violence of the jilted lover.

## Quoloth – The Devourer

Quoloth, The Devourer. A ravenous mass of draconic heads, each upon its own neck attached to a bloated and sagging saurian torso. His wings are drastically undersized for his frame, and when he flies he simply levitates his bulk by sheer force of will. He was a monk of Jashus in life, and a frequent Dreamwalker. He has since become the Corrupted Drake of Gluttony and Greed. Since departing Yewdar he has bent his every effort to accumulating the dreams, minds, and souls of mortal victims. His hunger is insatiable, and his thirst eternal. His followers on Yewdar tend to be charismatic narcissists: cult leaders, corrupt politicians, con artists, and the like. Over the Ages, there have been many entire cults dedicated to culling mortal souls for Quoloth; most recently, the Talons of Nightmare.

## Ator – The Fury

Ator, The Fury, the Corrupted Drake of Wrath and Vanity, was the first to fall to entropic temptation. She was a trusted lieutenant of Gur, goddess of War, and a preeminent voice among her Mantiswyrm kin. The lure of forbidden power turned her from her goddess, however, and in her enthusiasm she swayed three co-conspirators to her side in using this power to remake the world. In her entropic form, she is a battle-worn and well-weathered dragon with ragged wings and huge bony protrusions thrusting out from her rainbow-black scales in many directions. There are great gouges in her hide from battles both in Yewdar and Entropius, and her form is most like her original of any of the Corrupted Drakes. Her anger at being denied the goal she worked at for so long has stoked an unending rage in her heart, and her every thought is of unleashing vengeance upon the Twelve and their creations for her fate. Of all the Corrupted Drakes, she has the fewest mortal followers, but they are usually easy to spot in retrospect: there have been more than a few serial killers and soldiers whose berserk rampages are clear signs of Ator's hand at work.
