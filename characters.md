# Creating A Yewdar Character

Creating a Yewdar Character is similar to creating a normal Fantasy AGE character:

1. **Work up a character concept.** Devise a broad idea of who and what your character is, preferably a one-sentence description of their archetype and complication.
2. **Generate abilities.** Determine your character's physical and mental attributes as describe in the *Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook*.
3. **Choose a kith.** Yewdar adds [many new kith](kith.md) to the Fantasy AGE game. Your character can be one of three ethnicities of human, an elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, orc, drakon, Talosan, div'baharat or qandaha.
4. **Determine background.** Unlike the *Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook*, Yewdar does *not* tie character backgrounds to social class. It provides [new backgrounds](backgrounds.md) based on geographic regions to help you tailor your character more to the kith, cultures, and circumstances of Yewdar.
5. **Select a class.** Yewdar adds [three hybrid classes](classes.md) to the stock Mage, Rogue and Warrior: the Bard, Templar and Swashbuckler classes.
6. **Choose starting equipment.** Yewdar's high magic, high technology setting provides [new and exciting equipment options.](equipment.md)
7. **Calculate your Defense score.**
8. **Choose a name.**
9. **Choose goals and relationships.**

The full procedure for creating a character is listed in Chapter 1 of the *Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook*. Please refer to that volume to get started, and refer back to this document for steps 3-6.
