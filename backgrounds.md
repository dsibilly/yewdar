# Backgrounds

Your character has a story that predates their involvement in the adventures to come. Whether you came to your calling willingly or not, you did not appear out of thin air... unless_ \_you \_did_, and that in itself is a story! Character backgrounds represent your character did or trained to do before starting the adventurer's life. While the backgrounds in Chapter 1 of the _Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook_ are admirably broad, the backgrounds included here allow you to tailor your character more to the races, cultures, and circumstances of Yewdar.

## Regional Backgrounds

Yewdar backgrounds are based on where in the world your character hails from.

* [Kulturia](#kulturia)
* [Cthene](#cthene)
* [Grendian Mountains](#grendian-mountains)
* [Laurentia](#laurentia)
* [Hol Khozet](#hol-khozet)
* [Cheland](#cheland)
* [Reisian Principalities](#reisian-principalities)

### Kulturia

A hereditary monarchy. Known historically in that the Osan peoples overthrew the Nevrodt Empire. After colonizing the Laurentian Plains and discovering the arcanathyst deposits beneath Apex City, Kulturia became a world technology and economic powerhouse. With the secession and independence of Laurentia, the kingdom's future is now in doubt. Kulturians are proud of their history, but uniquely sensitive to individual rights despite being ruled by the Crown. The culture has vague Russian and Scandanavian influences.

### Cthene

There is no nation-state in the wastes, per-se. The territory is nominally Kulturian by right of conquest, but they exercise no authority nor enforce any laws there. An expansive desert badland, the Cthene Wastes are home to nomadic bands of Drakon, archaeologists in study, and ne'er-do-wells seeking to avoid civilization's attention.

### Grendian Mountains

The mountain range runs mostly north-south, splitting the continent in half. The range is home to many wild animals and is a rewarding hunting ground for those brave enough to venture into the foothills. Beneath the great peaks lie the great Dwarven holds, subterranean cities and villages. Due to the intensely private nature of the Dwarves, very few outsiders ever get to venture under the mountains. Clear mountain passes through the ridge are few, but with the advent of airships this no longer proves detrimental to continental trade.

### Laurentia

A newly established nation east of the Grendian Mountains and north of the jungles of Hol Khozet, Laurentia is an industrial juggernaut. Home to Apex City, the capital and largest city on the continent, Laurentia boasts most of the world's airship yards and is a chief exporter of arcanathyst to other nations. Outside of Apex, the rolling plains extend for hundreds of miles in all directions. Despite decent fertility, settlements on the plains are few; Kulturian interests focused on developing Apex City's material wealth instead of populating the countryside with settlers. The new Laurentian government, a technocratic oligarchy, has recently encouraged immigration to settle their outlying regions with an eye on increasing domestic tax revenue, agricultural production, and the pool of potential military conscripts.

### Hol Khozet

The expansive southern jungles of Osenia, Hol Khozet extends for hundreds of miles from the south border of Laurentia to the Horn of Reis at the tip of the continent. The jungles are deadly, filled with predatory and poisonous flora and fauna that will outright kill the ignorant, unprepared or unwary. The orcs evolved in this humid crucible, and from it they draw their legendary strength and tenacity. The most notable single feature of this region is Khozet Tharn, a large freshwater lake in the northern jungle. It is home to a variety of marine life as well as the only neutral ground in orcish society. Killing anything but game on its shores is taboo.

### Cheland

This land is a study in contrast. To the north, thousands of square kilometers of prarie plains host the most productive agriculture in the region, earning the island sub-continent the nickname "Breadbasket of Osenia." To the south, a dank fungal forest contains exotic and gargantuan mushrooms and other spore-based life, including the enigmatic myconids. Between north and south, a jagged ridge of mountains divides the island, crowned by an active volcano that the native Irsan peoples call "The Forge."

### Reisian Principalities

The seven island nations of the Reisian Principalities are the home of the halfling culture. Each island is its own sovereign nation, and each sends a delegation of representatives to the city of Hinshire on the island of Hinkios, where the Princes' Council sits. The Council manages relations between the islands and all foreign relations. The islands are:

* Hinkios \(largest island, capital\)
* Sokos
* Taros
* Raxos
* Korfea
* Phodes
* Icalonia

## Background Descriptions

You are invited to freely interpret your background to suit your character's history and experiences. Even two soldiers in the same army arrived to their service in the same way, and the details of their lives, fears, desires and aspirations are different. Take your character background as a way to help build the foundation of your character's past, not a limitation on their future.

### Arcanist

You have studied and trained in the science of magic, honing your skills to create new arcane items, empower magical conveniences, and repair them when they fail. The so-called "pure" mages may look down at you, but where they lose themselves in their explorations of personal power, you should take pride in your service, without which modern society would break down.

### Aristocrat

You were born to a noble family, and you take your family/clan ties very seriously. You were taught your letters and the arts, cultural and military history, by the best teachers your family could retain. You may be authentic and down-to-earth, or snooty and aloof, but your elevated status can insulate you from consequences that would give others hesitation.

### Artist

As the precocious child chases an enchanting butterfly, so do you seek ever after beauty. It may take a specific shape or many, but whether a poem, song, sculpture or painting, bringing beauty into the world drives you ever on. You may have apprenticed with another artist, in a studio with other aspiring creatives, or maybe you simply have exceptional natural talent. Regardless, you likely specialize in a particular style of art, and you must determine how to make your living from it.

### Chieftan/Matriarch

By birth, selection or rite of challenge, you lead \(or once led\) a sept of orc clanfolk. Many fists of warriors answer your call, and you are yourself a fierce combatant. While the sept serves you, you also serve the sept, and when a threat arises you may be called upon to leave your people and deal with it.

### Criminal

Via bad decisions or bad fortune, you've wound up outcast with no legitimate place in the world. Either by your own wits or the teaching of others, you've learned how to survive by any means possible. You know your way around the city, and how to spot a mark. You can tell which houses are worth robbing and which are a waste of time. And you know that if you're caught, you're dead.

### Exile

Maybe you did it. Maybe your family did. Regardless, _someone_ did _something_ that led to your exile. Maybe you made the wrong friends, or chose the wrong side in a conflict, or broke a taboo. Whatever it was, you've lived in the wilds for a while, and you know how to take care of yourself.

### Explorer

You are filled with wanderlust, a drive to go see what is over the next hill. Whether by sea, land, or air, you are thrilled by the journeying to new lands and finding forgotten places. Some explorers voyage for profit, some for the sheer joy of discovery. Your travels can lead to new trade routes, the preservation of history, or great wealth; you only need but set out!

### Fist Leader

You lead a fist of orcs, a band of warriors and mystics that carry the honor of your sept and clan. Your strength, whether by spell or spear, inspires your followers.
