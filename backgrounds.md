# Backgrounds

Your character has a story that predates their involvement in the adventures to come. Whether you came to your calling willingly or not, you did not appear out of thin air... unless _you did_, and that in itself is a story! Character backgrounds represent what your character did or trained to do before starting the adventurer's life. While the backgrounds in Chapter 1 of the _Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook_ are admirably broad, the backgrounds included here allow you to tailor your character more to the races, cultures, and circumstances of Yewdar.

## Regional Backgrounds

Yewdar backgrounds are based on where in the world your character hails from.

### Kulturia

An old, proud nation; home to the Osan human peoples. When formerly colonized by the Alsan peoples of the Aqori Imperium, they called the land Nevrodt. The Osan natives eventually overthrew Nevrodt in the late Tempest Age and established their own kingdom. After colonizing the Laurentian Plains and discovering the arcanathyst deposits beneath Apex City, Kulturia became a technological and economic powerhouse in the world. In the aftermath of the Bloodless War and the secession of Laurentia, the kingdom's future is now in doubt. Kulturia's climate is cold-to-temperate, with rich traditions of sailing, fishing, and animal husbandry. The government is a hereditary monarchy, with a number of aristocratic houses ruling the various cities and provinces that answer to the throne. The current reigning monarch is Queen Alasce. Kulturians are proud of their history, but uniquely sensitive to individual rights, despite being ruled by the Crown.

### Cthene

Cthene is not technically a nation-state. A large expanse of desert south of Kulturia, it is the location of a former dragon empire that aligned itself with the overthrown Nevrodt Empire. When the Day of Broken Scales transpired, the dragons that populated Cthene disappeared, and a natural disaster turned the region from grasslands and hill country into leagues of barren desert. Many bands of Drakon, left behind by their dragon creators, eke out a living in the Cthene Wastes. They band together in nomadic tribes that take shelter from the unforgiving desert climate in a series of protected sietches: rock formations that provide shelter from the sandstorms and brutal daytime sun. These tribes are not fully aligned with each other, and there is no functioning "national" government in the desert.

### Grendian Mountains

Slicing through the continent, the Grendian mountain range is home to Osenia's dwarven peoples. The range is home to many wild animals and is a rewarding hunting ground for those brave enough to venture into the foothills. Clear mountain passes through the ridge are few, but with the advent of airships this no longer proves detrimental to continental trade.

The dwarves live in great holds beneath the mountains, their subterranean cities and villages crafted by their steady, patient hands. They are an intensely private people, and few outsiders ever get to venture beneath the surface. The dwarven government has two political entities: the Crown and a feudal council known as the Clansraed. The Clansraed is a hereditary council of feudal aristocrats that expresses the will of the clans from across the mountains. The Crown is a hereditary monarchy maintained by the current ruling clan, who leads the clans in war and negotiates with other nations on their behalf. The ruling clan can be replaced by another clan by rite of combat against the ruling monarch or unanimous discommendation by the entire Clansraed. The current ruler is Dorin Axforge, who rules the clans from his clan's ancestral hold at Rockhome in central Grendia.

### Laurentia

A mercantile oligarchy that separated from Kulturia some 25 years ago. Home to Apex City, the great metropolis of the Osenian continent. Run by a council of powerful commercial enterprises and merchant houses, Laurentia is the largest producer of arcanathyst in the world. Laurentia boasts most of the world's airship yards, and the vehicles are their second-largest export. They have a large population of Talosan, artificial constructs, which were built to serve as an army in what was assumed to be a civil war against the Kulturian crown. When Kulturia stood down their forces on the eve of battle in what would be known as the Bloodless War, the Talosan were found to have developed sentience. They have since integrated (somewhat) into society. Laurentia is governed by the Board of Ministers. The current First Minister is Dimitri Vengar, owner of the Mesa Yield Mining company.

Outside of Apex, the rolling plains extend for hundreds of miles in all directions. Despite decent fertility, settlements on the plains are few; Kulturian interests focused on developing Apex City's material wealth instead of populating the countryside with settlers. The new Laurentian government has recently encouraged immigrants to settle their outlying regions with an eye on increasing domestic tax revenue, agricultural production, and the pool of potential military conscripts.

### Hol Khozet

The vast jungles of Southern Osenia. While not an officially declared nation as others might be, all other countries respect the jungles as de facto sovereign territory of the orcish people. The jungles themselves are dense, dark, and dangerous to lifeforms not prepared for its vicious cycles of life and death. The orcs evolved in this humid crucible, and from it they draw their legendary strength and tenacity. The orcs have had extensive contact with the rest of the world, but not as a single entity. There are thirteen orcish clans, and each has its own traditions and opinions on dealing with other peoples and travel to other lands. There is a history of bitter conflict between the orcs and the dwarves of Grendia, with whom they share the longest national border on the continent.

The most notable single feature of this region is Khozet Tharn, a large freshwater lake in the northern jungle. It is home to a variety of marine life as well as the only neutral ground in orcish society. Killing anything but game on its shores is taboo.

### Cheland

Cheland is not a single nation. The island sub-continent is bisected by the same mountain range that forms Grendia on the mainland. To the north of the mountains are thousands of square kilometers of prairie plains that host the most productive agriculture in the region. South of the mountains lies a dank fungal forest that contains exotic and gargantuan mushrooms and other spore-based lifeâ€¦ including the enigmatic myconids. The mountain range itself is a jagged ridge crowned by an active volcano that the native Irsan human peoples call "the Forge." Cheland's Irsan culture is the only democracy on the continent; their monarch is elected by popular vote to a six-year term. The current queen is Rike (pronounced _REE-kuh_) Trubel, a rice farmer from the Lake Edi region.

### Reisian Principalities

An archipelago of seven islands off the southeast coast of Osenia, the Reisian Principalities are the political homeland of the halfling peoples. The islands were granted to their first leader, Reis the Grand Explorer, as a boon for her intrepid expedition to map the entirety of the continent. The Principalities are seven independent states that trade and negotiate with each other while interacting as a single nation with other countries. The seven islands are Hinkios, Sokos, Taros, Raxos, Korfea, Phodes, and Icalonia. Their low latitude and tropical climate make the islands a destination for well-heeled tourists, sea- and air-going merchants, and explorers of all kinds. Their capital, Hinshire, upon the big island of Hinkios, is a major port for trade with the halflings, orcs, Cheland, and northern Osenia.

You are invited to freely interpret your background to suit your character's history and experiences. Even two soldiers in the same army will not have arrived to their service in the same way, and the details of their lives, fears, desires, and aspirations are different. Treat your character background as a way to help build the foundation of your character's past, not a limitation on their future.

### Arcanist

You have studied and trained in the science of magic, honing your skills to create new arcane items, empower magical conveniences, and repair them when they fail. The so-called "pure" mages may look down at you, but where they lose themselves in their explorations of personal power, you should take pride in your service. Modern society would certainly break down without you.

### Aristocrat

You were born to a noble family, and you take your family/clan ties seriously. You were taught your letters and the arts, cultural and military history, by the best teachers your family could retain. You may be authentic and down-to-earth, or snooty and aloof, but your elevated status insulates you from consequences that cause others to hesitate.

### Artist

As the precocious child chases an enchanting butterfly, so do you seek ever after beauty. It may take a specific shape or many, but whether a poem, song, sculpture or painting, bringing beauty into the world drives you ever on. You may have apprenticed with another artist, in a studio with other aspiring creatives, or maybe you simply have exceptional natural talent. Regardless, you likely specialize in a particular style of art, and you must determine how to make your living from it.

### Criminal

Via bad decisions or bad fortune, you've wound up an outcast with no legitimate place in the world. Either by your own wits or the teaching of others, you've learned how to survive by any means possible. You know your way around the city, and how to spot a mark. You can tell which houses are worth robbing and which are a waste of time. And you know that if you're caught, you're dead.

### Exile

Maybe you did it. Maybe your family did. Regardless, _someone_ did _something_ that led to your exile. Maybe you made the wrong friends, or chose the wrong side in a conflict, or broke a taboo. Whatever it was, you've lived in the wilds for a while, and you know how to take care of yourself.

### Explorer

You are filled with wanderlust, a drive to go see what is over the next hill. Whether by sea, land, or air, journeying to new lands and finding forgotten places thrills you. Some explorers voyage for profit, some for the sheer joy of discovery. Your travels may lead to new trade routes, the preservation of history, or great wealth; you need only set out!

### Fist Leader (Orc)

You lead a fist of orcs, a small band of warriors and mystics that carry the honor of your sept and clan. Your strength, whether by spell or spear, inspires your followers. Whether scouting, hunting, or marching to war, you are the backbone of orcish might and all glory begins at the tip of your spear.

### Functionary (Dwarf)

The intricately formal society of the dwarves requires intermediaries like you who keep the cogs of their kingdoms turning. You take the orders from your superiors, be they guilders, nobles, or merchant princes, and you make sure their wishes are carried out while adhering to the dwarven law and tradition.

### Grunt (Orc)

You are an orcish laborer, one of the builders, choppers, or artisans who make your sept's holdings livable in the hostile jungle. You are strong from a life of carrying supplies and resources. Where the clan warriors are fierce, you are durable. You are the last line of defense for your people, and your broad shoulders carry the weight of all others.

### Guilder

You work for one of the powerful mercantile or craft guilds that control trade in the larger cities. You may know a trade, or you may just know how to manipulate money and people to get what you want. Your talents and connections ensure you and your family do quite well, which is how you hope to keep it.

### Hermit

You left civilization for some reason to become a hermit. Perhaps you took a holy vow, perhaps you needed time alone to ponder an important question or remove yourself from a difficult situation, or perhaps you just donâ€™t care for people and are happy to be on your own. Time on your own has hardened you and made you self-reliant.

### Laborer

You carry, lift, tote, throw, handle, move, or otherwise deal with loads of material that have to be moved off of or onto ships or wagons or into buildings. The work isnâ€™t difficult, but it is physically demanding, and you have the stamina and strength to show for it.

### Merchant

You have a way with people and you use that in your business dealings to become successful. You use your charisma to get the best deals or to convince others theyâ€™re getting the best deal. It's all in service to your success. You may have a small merchant stand selling odds and ends in a bazaar, or you may operate a thriving shop that specializes in carpets, foreign imports, or other valuables. Instead of a store, perhaps you travel from one place to another, buying unusual items in one place and transporting them to sell in another. Regardless of the type of merchant you are, you know how to come out ahead in any deal.

### Mystic

You have been initiated into the hidden mysteries, and know rituals to curry favor with the gods or spirits. In you is preserved the ancient knowledge, passed down in an unbroken line from the mystics of old to those they deemed worthy to carry on the sacred traditions. Some may respect you, while others may find your practices odd or objectionable. You don't care; through such practice you've touched true wisdom.

### Nomad

The open road calls to you, and you have answered. Instead of calling a single location home, you regard the entire world as yours. You love to wander. You constantly seek out new places, and meet new people. You rarely get lost, but even when you do, it usually turns out to be an adventure worth experiencing.

### Performer

You are a dancer, actor, musician, singer, or some other sort of performer. You enjoy getting in front of a room of people and affecting them in some way with your performance. You especially like it when they show their appreciation in other ways, such as with money, favors, or affection.

### Sailor

You know your way around a ship better than most. Youâ€™ve trained and lived at sea for long stretches of time, either in a navy or on a trading shipâ€”maybe both at different times. You may call some port home, but most of your time is spent at sea, so youâ€™ve traveled to many different parts of the world and seen things few can dream of.

### Scholar

When lords, generals, and politicians have questions, they come to you. Youâ€™ve studied extensively and if you donâ€™t know an answer to a question, you can likely find someone else or a book that does. Others may change the course of history, but youâ€™re the one who tells them how to do it.

### Scribe

Books, scrolls, and portfolios are what you fill your time with. The greatest libraries and universities of your time require your services to do what they do and they pay well for your services. Knowledge that no one ever sees isnâ€™t knowledge â€” itâ€™s a secret. When you get your hands on secrets, you commit them to books, then preserve and spread that knowledge across the world and through time. Do you revel in the importance of your profession or despise it as an isolating, backbreaking task?

### Skysailor

See [Sailor](#sailor)

### Soldier

You're a soldier, possibly even a guard or mercenary, who has signed up to fight for your country. Youâ€™ve trained for combat, but you also had an education in how to live and work as part of a unit as well as how to take and execute an order. A soldier who doesnâ€™t follow orders is useless. Perhaps your time as a soldier is over and youâ€™re on your own again, or maybe you deserted for some reason.

### Tradesperson

Resting somewhere between the laborer and guilder, the tradesperson specializes in some kind of skilled manual labor, such as masonry, carpentry, clockmaking, blacksmithing, or any of dozens of other trades. Youâ€™ve been trained in a trade and know how to talk about its practical and theoretical applications, which allows you to accurately plan and execute jobs.

### Warcaller (Orc)

By birth, selection, or rite of challenge, you lead \(or once led\) a sept of orc clanfolk. Many fists of warriors answer your call, and you are yourself a fierce combatant in your own right. While the sept serves you, you also serve the sept, and when a threat arises you may be called upon to leave your people and deal with it personally.

### Wise One (Orc)

See [Mystic](#mystic)
