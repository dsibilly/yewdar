## The Osan

In the early Tempest Age, the Osan were divided into petty fiefdoms across their ancestral lands. The struggles of the Black Age had left their settlements scattered and disorganized, striving to recover. Then the Aqori ships came to their shores.

In those days, to avoid contentious squabbles between Imperial heirs and their younger siblings, the Aqori younglings were sent off on colonizing expeditions over the horizon. Lord Nevro, third son of the Imperator, took thirty ships and headed northeast.

Nevro's expedition landed in Osenia and made contact with the Osan peoples. First contact was peaceful and friendly, but within a decade the Aqori's colonizing efforts had established them as masters of their new home. Nevro unified the Osan lands and named himself Emperor. By the end of the Tempest Age, the Osan natives of the Nevrodt Empire chafed under their government's rule. Only people of Aqori descent could be full citizens. Protests grew, and from there a rebellion. By the dawn of the Mourning Age, the Osan had overthrown their Aqori masters and taken control of their homeland. Named Kulturia after the leader of their rebellion, Kulturon the Liberator, they went on to forge an enduring power on the continent. Osan peoples now hold power in two large nation-states on Osenia: Kulturia, the same hereditary kingdom created post-rebellion; and Laurentia, a mercantile plutocracy based around Apex City. Osan can be found in nearly every populated area as merchants, expats, and mercenaries.
 
## Lord Nevro and His Empire

Lord Nevro was from the Aqori Imperium, the third son of Imperator Jaxur IX, and of Alsan heritage. He and his people landed in Osenia, made friends with the locals, and proceeded to build a settlement near modern-day Rivenmouth. The knowledge gap between the Aqori settlers and the Osan natives was non-trivial. The locals marveled at the grandeur of their new neighbors' homes, and the speed at which they were built. Many older Kulturian towns are still built on road plans brought over by the Aqori.

It was by proliferating internal improvements and controlling access to magical knowledge that Nevro managed to bring the disparate Osan fiefs together into a single political whole. Few people were willing to revert to older, harder, slower ways once the Aqori arrived. It was later, as a procession of Nevro's descendants began to rule, that prejudices started to assert themselves in Nevrodt culture. Those of Alsan heritage were considered "superior" by the ruling class, themselves Alsan, and such beliefs were codified into the laws & traditions. Suffice to say that the Nevrodt Empire's legacy is one of massive societal change for the continent and the Osan people, but also one of inequality, discrimination, and ultimately largest war of the Tempest Age.

## The Elves

The elves of Yewdar are expatriates of the Verdance, much like the gnomish folk. They have been here much longer than the gnomes, however. Arriving in the Sublime Age, the Dusk Clan of the Eladar sought to escape a vicious holy war between their Dawn and Midlight Clan cousins. They settled the far-northern continent of Ikaemo, where they established a mighty empire, Nari'el, under their leader the Twilight Speaker. From the Sublime Age through most of the Mourning Age, they maintained a beautiful, erudite culture there that traded with the world.

As the elves expanded their settlements northward toward the Aurora Peaks, they began to encounter a primitive culture of tall, grey-skinned humanoids that dwelled near the mountains and in the tundra beyond. They called themselves the turahls \(now colloquially known as trolls\). Early relations between the elves and the turahls were peaceful and prosperous. The elves taught their new neighbors improved building and crafting techniques, while the turahls taught the elves how to survive in the icy wastes of beyond the peaks, and where the good hunting was. In time, the turahls established a city of their own on the northern slopes of the Aurora Peaks. Called Rakash, it was a shining symbol of elf and turahl partnership and co-existence.

The turahls, however, resented that of all the things the elves shared with them, they would not share their magic. Midway through the Mourning Age, something changed in the turahls. They had always been a mercurial folk, but a demagogue named Dram Dun Tlop capitalized on lingering resentments to galvanize the turahl tribes against their neighbors and partners in Nari'el.

In time, the turahls spilled over the mountains in great waves of angry warbands, bringing the elves' own lessons to bear against them. The elves had the technological and magical advantage, but the short-lived and fast-breeding turahls overwhelmed an unready nation.

With much of their nation conquered in a matter of months, many elves escaped the sacking of their coastal cities via sea, taking to their ships that no turahl warboat could catch. These refugees formed the Eladar fleet, a massive flotilla some 500 ships strong. By this time, the lands of Yewdar were all settled… and no nation was willing to yield territory to a new elvish nation. For the last three centuries, the Eladar Fleet has sailed the world. 

The elves' leader, the prophetess Lalahni, claims that she will deliver her people to a new promised land, the Third Land Danari’el. All of modern elvish culture revolves around keeping the fleet safe and finding this prophesied home.

## The Gnomes

The gnomes are not native to Yewdar. They arrived in the Tempest Age when their greatest magisters helped them escape their home in the Verdance. The gnomish people were originally underground denizens of the Verdance. Industrious, inquisitive, and skilled at avoiding notice, they thrived in subterranean reaches where the Midlight Clan of elves did not hold sway. During the Tempest Age, insectoid Formics emerged from the deep places and began to displace the gnomes systematically.

The gnomish people fought to defend themselves, but their foe was organized, implacable, and outnumbered them 10 to 1. In the end, a few hundred gnomish survivors, cornered in a minor holding with nowhere else to go, turned to their mages. The wizened old masters bent their magic to powerful portals that pierced the barrier between planes, and the gnomes escaped their fallen homeland.

The gnomes have integrated themselves into most major cultures around Yewdar in the ~1,700 years since their arrival. They are still an industrious and inquisitive people, but their originally sunny outlook has been displaced by wary skepticism and a desire to prepare for misfortune.

## The Ogres

The ogres do not exist in the histories of any mortal peoples. Ogres have been exceptionally rare on Yewdar since the Black Age, before any of the surviving kith began keeping historical records. What is known of the ogres comes down from archaeology, myths, and oral tradition. The ogres were immense humanoids that measured over three meters tall, azure skinned, and possessed of both great strength and towering intellect.

There is no firm estimate of how many ogres there were, but archaeological digs have found ruins of large buildings and other constructs with magical construction techniques matched only by the dragons of Cthene. Most of these finds are clustered around the equator.

Since the dawn of the Tempest Age, there have been few encounters with living ogres, or at least an offshoot of their people. These “lesser ogres” are feral, brutish versions of the mythic originals, more given to hunting and subsistence than the great works of their forebears.

Amazingly, there are a few written ogre works that survived the tumult of the Black Age, preserved in their ruins by means unknown to modern magic. This has allowed scholars to decipher some of their written language and gain a small understanding of them…

Ogre society was matriarchal, and their understanding of magic and the physical world surpassed that of even current scholars millennia later. They were intensely interested in the nature of reality, and their worldview bridged philosophy and magic in confounding ways.

Unlike with the dragons, there is no historical date or chronological record of the ogre’s disappearance from Yewdar. They were in Yewdar in the Sublime Age, and not seen again after the daemonic invasion of the Black Age. All that remains are their buried works.

Ogre works are very geometric in design. They were quite taken by clean, precise polygonal and polyhedral design, with a particular preference for triangles, pentagons, and dodecahedrons.

### The Strange Case of Naur Xa'dir

A special agent of the Kulturian Navy, elf Naur Xa’dir, has now had two separate encounters with what appear to be spectral ogres. These encounters occurred a dozen years apart, with the current incident on an unknown island in the southern Great Ocean… near the equator.

In the first encounter, Agent Xa’dir seems to have participated in a disjoint timeline where an airship he was on exploded in midair. There were no survivors.

Days later the airship arrived, intact, at its next destination with all crew and passengers aboard.
The only evidence of Agent Xa’dir’s recounting of his experiences is that he arrived back at base in possession of an ogre tome no others had heard of or seen before… in the original bindings and in *pristine* condition.
