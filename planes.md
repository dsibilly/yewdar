# The Planes

Yewdar is paralleled by three dimensional planes that, with great effort, can be made coterminous with the material plane. The existence of these planes is general knowledge. Physically entering them is not and is usually the realm of powerful magics, divine intervention, or the side effect of incredible power being released. However, some places on Yewdar have thinner veils than others.

## Vakaré

Vakaré is the realm of dreams. Simply put, it is where your mind goes when you sleep at night. This is the domain of Jashus, King of Dreams. Physically entering Vakaré is nigh impossible, but all sentient beings perceive some version of it when they dream. Clearly there is some mechanism by which a slumbering mind journeys there with ease.

## The Endless Halls

The Endless Halls are Abasys’ resting place for the souls under her protection. There are halls for the worthy to dine with their gods and heroes, halls for the unworthy to atone for their misdeeds, and halls of unending anguish for those who fell truly afoul of the gods.

## The Verdance

The Verdance is an echo of Yewdar, mirroring the world’s general shape and form but in a primal and untamed sense. Nature is more lush and exceedingly more dangerous here. There is some relationship between Yewdar and The Verdance beyond their maps, though no one seems to understand what that is. It is also original home realm of the elves and gnomish peoples. Of all the planes, physically entering The Verdance is seemingly easiest, though nowhere near commonplace in Osenian civilization.
