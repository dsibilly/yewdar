## New Ability Focuses
A focus is an area of expertise within a more broad ability. These are explained in detail in the Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook. Descriptions of the ability focuses added in Yewdar follow. Your GM has final say on whether a focus applies for a given ability test.

### Accuracy Focuses
**Blaster Longarms**: Proficiency with weapons of the Blaster Longarms Weapon Group.

**Blaster Pistols**: Proficiency with weapons of the Blaster Pistols Weapon Group.

**Heavy Weapons**: Proficiency with weapons of the Heavy Weapons Weapon Group.

### Dexterity Focuses
**Advanced Driving**: Maneuvering powered vehicles, as opposed to the carts and wagons to which Strength (Driving) applies.

**Piloting**: Maneuvering an airship or other flying vehicle.


### Intelligence Focuses
**Artifice**: Building, repairing and understanding manufactured magical items and artifacts.

## New Talents
Talents are areas of natural aptitude or training that your character has acquired in their journey through life.

### Heavy Weapons Style
**Classes**: Any

**Requirements**: You must be trained in the Heavy Weapons Weapon Group

You can cause devastating damage with artillery weapons.

**Novice**: When you take the Aim action while using a Heavy Weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to damage dealt on a successful hit.

**Journeyman**: You've learned to pinpoint weaknesses in enemy ship and fortress defenses. When using a Heavy Weapon, you can perform the Pierce Armor stunt for 1 stunt point instead of the usual 2.

**Master**: You know how to fire for effect with Heavy Weapons. When using a Heavy Weapon, you can perform the Lethal Blow stunt for 4 stunt points instead of the usual 5.

### High Artifice
**Classes**: Bard, Mage

**Requirements**: Intelligence +1, at least one magic talent

You can use (and abuse) magical items with ease.

**Novice**: If you fail an Intelligence (Artifice) test, you can re-roll it. You must keep the results of the second roll.

**Journeyman**: When you attempt to use an unfamiliar magical device or override a magical lock with Intelligence (Artifice), you gain a +2 bonus to your roll.

**Master**: You are an experienced artificer. When making Intelligence (Artifice) tests as part of an advanced test, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of your Stunt Die. This allows you to reach the success threshold of the advanced test faster.

### Marksmanship Style
**Classes**: Rogue, Swashbuckler, Warrior

**Requirements**: Must be trained in Blaster Longarms Weapon Group

You are a trained rifleman.

**Novice**: You know how to punish enemies who get too close. When shooting a blaster longarm at an enemy within 6 yards, you inflict a bonus +1 damage on a successful hit.

**Journeyman**: When shooting with a blaster longarm, you can perform the Knock Prone stunt for 1 stunt point instead of the usual 2.

**Master**: When you make a successful attack with a blaster longarm you may choose to re-roll the damage, but you must keep the results of the second roll.

### Performance

**Classes**: Any

**Requirements**: Communications (Performance), Intelligence (Musical Lore).

You have a natural talent for performing in front of others.

**Novice**: You know how to sing, play an instrument, write and read music. You are also an accomplished actor and performer. Choose *one* of the Jest, Stunned Silence or Sway the Crowd roleplaying stunts. You may perform that stunt for 1 SP lest than its normal cost.

**Journeyman**: You can get the feel of a room and adapt your performance to suit it. If you have 15 minutes to observe a crowd before performing of speaking in front of them, you gain a +1 bonus to any Communication-based tests made to persuade or entertain them. In addition, pick another roleplaying stunt from the Novice degree of this talent; you perform that stunt at 1 SP less than its usual cost.

**Master**: When performing, you ooze confidence and style. You may perform the With a Flourish exploration stunt while entertaining an audience for 3 SP instead of the usual 5 SP, and its effects last until the end of the day.

### Pistoleer Style
**Classes**: Rogue, Swashbuckler, Warrior

**Requirements**: You must be trained in the Blaster Pistols Weapon Group.

Handling a blaster pistol is second nature.

**Novice**: It's hard to get the drop on you. Once per round you can use a Ready action with a blaster as a free action.

**Journeyman**: Enemies that get close to you regret it. When shooting at a target at short range, you inflict +1 damage.

**Master**: You can get the most out of each slot. When shooting a blaster, you can perform the Dual Strike stunt for 3 stunt points instead of the usual 4.

## Specializations
Specializations are a way to focus and customize your character's abilities and powers. Two Swashbuckler friends may share an affinity for finesse and daring, but a Dervish's agility sets them apart from the weapon mastery of a Blade.

You gain access to specializations starting at Level 4. At that level you gain the Novice degree of a specialization talent of your choice, provided you satisfy the prerequisites. At Level 6, you gain the Journeyman degree, and the Master degree at Level 8; this is the only way to advance degrees in specialization talents. You may take a second specialization at Level 12, with further degrees at Level 14 and Level 16.

The specializations included below are a combination of those added by the _Fantasy AGE Companion_ and reskinned for use in Yewdar, and original specializations. Some original specializations are intended for use with Yewdar's [expanded classes](/classes.md).

If you do not wish to take a specialization, or do not qualify for one at Level 4 or Level 12, you can instead take a degree in a regular talent instead of a specialization talent. The next time your class grants you degree in a specialization talent, you can take a specialization at that point or take another regular talent.

**Example**: *Noreen the dwarven templar reaches Level 4. She could take a specialization at this point, but opts to take a degree of Armor Training instead. When she reaches Level 6, she faces the same choice. This time she chooses to become an Inquisitor, taking the Novice degree of that specialization talent. When she reaches Level 8, she takes the Journeyman degree. When she reaches Level 12, she could take the Master degree of Inquisitor, or start a new specialization at the Novice degree.*

### Agent

You are a master of intrigue and espionage. Agents work freelance or for shadowy organizations to thwart (or *cause*) threats that would spiral out of control if left to unfold on their own.

**Classes**: Any

**Requirements**: Perception 2+, Communication 2+, Intrigue (Novice), Observation (Novice).

**Novice**: You are adept at assuming identities and impersonation. If you fail a Communication (Disguise) test, you may reroll it but must accept the result of the second roll.

**Journeyman**: You know how to gather information quickly and accurately without being discovered. You may perform the Efficient Search and Speedy Search stunts for 1 SP each instead of their usual 2 SP cost.

**Master**: You are difficult to capture, and even more difficult to keep in captivity. You gains a +1 bonus to any tests that involve evading capture or escaping imprisonment.

### Arcane Dabbler

You may not have the skill of a mage or the divine might of a templar, but you tap some minor capability with magic to enhance your own talents and abilities.

**Classes**: Rogue, Swashbuckler, Warrior

**Requirements**: Intelligence 2+, Willpower 2+, Intelligence (Arcane Lore).

**Novice**: You gain one Novice spell from any arcana. You also gain Magic Points equal to your Willpower x 5 + Intelligence.

**Journeyman**: You gain one Novice spell from any arcana. Reduce the Strain of casting in armor by 3.

**Master**: You gain one Journeyman spell of any arcana. Alternatively, you may take two more Novice spells from any arcana.

### Blackguard

Some Templar are beacons of light and righteousness. You are *not* one of them. By the calling of your god or a shadow across your soul, you have become a bastion of fear. You are dark redoubt of divine might.

**Class**: Templar

**Requirements**: Strength 2+, Willpower 2+, Power or Shadow Arcana (Novice).

**Novice**: Dark energies surge around you. You may spend 3 MP with an Activate action to create a Vulnerability Aura in a 2-yard radius around you. Enemies within the aura suffer a -1 penalty to Defense. This aura lasts until the end of the encounter.

**Journeyman**: You instill great fear. If you fail a Strength (Intimidate) test, you may re-roll it. You must keep the results of the second roll.

**Master**: Your Vulnerability Aura becomes increasingly debilitating. Enemies within your aura receive a -2 penalty on all opposed ability tests against you.

### Blade

Your blade is an extension of your self, and combined you are a finely honed weapon of grace and skill. You are an expert duelist, adept at using your opponents relatively ungainly movements against them. Your speed and misdirection exposes your opponents weaknesses and evades their clumsy tricks.

**Class**: Swashbuckler

**Requirements**: Communication 2+, either Accuracy (Curved Blades) or Accuracy (Dueling).

**Novice**: Your quick movements can throw your opponent off-balance, leaving them vulnerable to your attacks. You add your Communication on damage rolls with weapons from the Dueling or Curved Blade groups (select one). You also can perform the Taunt stunt for 1 SP instead of the usual 2.

**Journeyman**: You and your weapon are never parted. You cannot be disarmed; stunt points spent trying to part you from your weapon are wasted.

**Master**: You easily relieve opponents of their weapons. You can perform the Disarm stunt for 1 SP instead of the usual 2.

### Chronicler
You are a historian, scribe, and proficient forger.

**Classes**: Bard

**Requirements**: Intelligence 2+, Talent: Lore (Novice)

**Novice**: You are a collector of histories. If you fail an Intelligence (Historical Lore) test, you may re-roll it, but you must keep the results of the second roll.

**Journeyman**: You are a master of the written word. Any tests that require you to understand a written work, such as Intelligence (Cryptography), Intelligence (Research), or Intelligence (Writings), only take half as long to complete. You may also copy written works at twice normal speed, and create very convincing forgeries of documents that you possess a copy of or are familiar with. (The GM is the ultimate arbiter of this talent.)

**Master**: You may call upon the heroes of old with a new Bard Song: *Song of Heroes Returned*. Once per day while Bard Song is active, make a Communication (Performance) test for each unconscious ally within 10 yards. The target number is 17. If you succeed, the target ally gains health equal to the Stunt Die + your Communication.

### Dervish

Through practice and ritual you have attained deep insight into the art of battle... and it is indeed an art to you. Every fight is a performance, and you are a virtuoso in motion. While the song of spell and steel rings out, you are never still. You dart through the fray like a tumbling force of nature, and your foes struggle to keep up.

**Class**: Swashbuckler

**Requirements**: Dexterity 2+, Dexterity (Acrobatics) focus.

**Novice**: Nothing gets in your way. If you fail a Dexterity (Acrobatics) test, you can re-roll it. You must keep the results of the second roll.

**Journeyman**: You somersault back to your feet even after being knocked down. You can attempt a TN 17 Dexterity (Acrobatics) test after any effect that would normally knock you prone, such as the Knock Prone stunt. If you succeed, you remain standing.

**Master**: You dash in and out of danger in the blink of an eye. You may move up to your total speed when you use the Charge action, instead of the usual half speed. Also, you may make the attack portion of the Charge action *at any point during your movement*; after the attack, you may continue to move, but at half your speed.

### Dreamwalker

**Class:** Mage, Templar
**Requirements:** Intelligence 2, Willpower 2, and the Intelligence (Arcane Lore) focus

You are touched by Jashus, and can wield the powers Vakaré, the Realm of Dreams.

**Novice:** You gain the Novice degree of the Dream Arcana. Additionally, you can blur the line between the waking world and Vakaré. When you take damage, you can attempt to step into a space Between so that your physical body partially fades. The amount of damage you take from the attack is reduced by a number equal to your Willpower. This ability lasts until the beginning of your next turn, and may be used a number of times per day equal to your Constitution.

**Expert:** Your experiences exploring dreams has empowered your spell casting. You may perform the Lasting Spell spell stunt for 1 SP less than usual. Once per encounter, you may also add your Intelligence (Arcane Lore) focus bonus to any other Lore-based test.

**Master:** You only require 4 hours of sleep per day. Your connection to Vakaré has developed enough to allow you to summon a Thoughtedge Blade that you are automatically proficient with. The blade appears as a long sword made of crystal, but is harder than steel while in use. Using the Thoughtedge Blade requires an Intelligence (Dream Arcana) test to attack; the result of the test is the Defense you are able to hit. Damage is 1d6 + 4 + your Willpower. The blade persists for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Willpower.

### Fire Dancer
You channel the heat of passion into arcane might with your graceful dances, replacing song with athletic undulation.

**Class**: Bard

**Requirements**: Communication 2+, Dexterity 2+

**Novice**: Allies and enemies only need to see you in order to be affected by your Bard Song. You may also add the Fire Arcana magic talent to your list of Bard Arcana.

**Journeyman**: You become inured to heat and flame. You reduce the damage you take from fire and fire effects, such as Fire Arcana spells, by half (rounded down.)

**Master**: You learn to call fire with your song with a new Bard Song: *Song of the Dancing Dragon*. While Bard Song is active, you may cast Fire Arcana spells for 1 less magic point (minimum 1 MP).

### Holy Champion

Even among your brethren, you are an exemplar of selflessness and holy power. When the battle is joined, you are your companions' shield and a glorious weapon of divine fury.

**Class**: Templar

**Requirements**: Constitution 2+, Willpower 2+.

**Novice**: You imbue your weapon with magic. You may spend 2 MP and an Activate action to treat your Weapon of Faith as a magic weapon for 5 minutes.

**Journeyman**: You can choose to put yourself in harm's way for allies. When you Defend or Guard Up, you can choose one ally within 2 yards to receive the Defense bonus instead of you.

**Master**: You can channel some of your power through your weapon. As an Activate action, spend 2 or more MP (up to your Willpower); for every 2 MP spent add +1 penetrating damage to your next hit with your weapon.

### Inquisitor

You are the embodiment of divine justice. Those who have sinned in the eyes of your god have no sanctuary from you. You will find those who have earned your retribution, you shall give them no quarter... for justice will not dispense itself.

**Class**: Templar

**Requirements**: Perception 2+, Observation (Novice) talent.

**Novice**: You single out an opponent for justice. With an Activate action, designate one enemy you can see within 10 yards as your Quarry. You receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls made against your Quarry.

**Journeyman**: You are adept at pursuit. If you fail a Perception (Tracking) test, you can re-roll it. You must keep the results of the second roll.

**Master**: Your enemies may run, but they cannot hide. With an Activate action, spend 3 MP to remove any penalty to your attack against your Quarry due to cover.

### Oracle (Cleric of N'er)

The Child-God of Time has granted you the ability to see the future, read portents, and influence coming events in small ways. Many if not most oracles are not adventurers, but those who follow that path find their powers valuable... if not always *reliable*.

**Class**: Mage

**Requirements**: Perception 2+, Fate Arcana (Novice), Divination Arcana (Novice).

**Novice**: You can foretell good fortune, but you are unsure when it will take hold. You gain access to the Foretell stunt:

| SP Cost | Stunt |
|:-------:|:------|
| 2+ | **Foretell**: Select an ally (including yourself.) Once before the end of the encounter, when they generate stunt points, that ally may gain +1 SP for every 2 SP you spend on this stunt. |

**Journeyman**: You can avoid costly errors by reading signs and portents. You may spend 5 MP and name a particular ability and focus. For the rest of the encounter, you may re-roll tests of that type at the cost of 2 MP per test. You **must** take the results of the second roll, however, and cannot re-roll any single test more than once &mdash; you can push fate only so far.

**Master**: You learn to advise others more effectively with your powers. You may use your Journeyman degree on any ally you can freely communicate with during an encounter.

### Scoundrel

You've lived by the sword long enough to know that it's only a matter of time before someone brings a bigger sword. Luckily, you have your trusty arcane blaster. It has limited ammo, sure, but what it gives you is *options*... like keeping this street thug's friends behind cover down the alleyway while you relieve him of the money pouch he just stole, ya ken?

**Class**: Swashbuckler

**Requirements**: Accuracy 2+, Perception 2+, Pistoleer Style (Novice)

**Novice**: If you don't already have it, you gain the Accuracy (Blaster Pistols) focus. When attacking with a Blaster Pistol you may perform the Lightning Attack stunt for 2 SP instead of the usual 3.

**Journeyman**: You are deadly with a melee weapon and firearm. When dual-wielding a melee weapon and blaster, you receive a +1 bonus on all your damage rolls.

**Master**: You are a storm of steel and blaster bolts. If you make a melee attack with your primary weapon and are not charging, you may make a ranged attack with your secondary blaster as a minor action. The second attack cannot generate stunt points. You may only add half your Perception (rounded down) to the damage roll.

### Scythe (Cleric of Abasys)

As a disciple of the goddess of death, you are skilled with magic relating to expiration. Your access to the Death Arcana has proven a gateway to many abilities some would consider to be... unnatural.

**Class**: Mage, Templar

**Requirements**: Intelligence 2+, Intelligence (Death Arcana).

**Novice**: Your hand can bar the doorway between life and death, sending those on the threshold back to Yewdar or onward to the Endless Halls. With an Activate action, touch a target with 0 Health. They can either be instantly killed or stabilized at 0 Health but no longer Dying (your choice.)

**Journeyman**: Each time you spend MP to gain an additional effect with a Death Arcana spell (e.g. make an additional question of the departed, animate another corpse, et al.,) you gain double the effect for the same cost. You can also converse with any undead within sight regardless of language barriers or physical limitations.

**Master**: Death surrounds and sustains you. Whenever a living creature dies within 6 yards of you, gain either 2 Health or 2 Magic Points. This effect stacks with the *draw upon death* spell if it is active. If you kill a target with your Novice Necromancer talent, you gain 1d6+2 Health or Magic Points instead.

### Skald
You are a warrior-poet, telling tales and singing songs to drive your allies to greater heights of heroism.

**Classes**: Bard

**Requirements**: Communication 2+, Accuracy or Fighting 2+

**Novice**: You take up arms alongside your allies. You become eligible for the Armor Training talent. You ignore up to 2 Strain while casting spells in armor.

**Journeyman**: You spur your allies forward with ballads, songs and sagas. You and your allies move 25% faster (rounded down) than normal when moving overland and not in combat (e.g. speed 10 characters move 12 yards/round.)

**Master**: You inspire your allies into a berserker fury with a new Bard Song: *Song of Fury*. Select a number of allies equal to your Communication that are within 12 yards and can both see and hear you. While Bard Song is active, the affected allies gain a +2 bonus on Willpower (Courage) and Willpower (Morale) tests, and a +1 bonus to damage rolls in melee combat. However, they suffer a -1 penalty to Defense and Perception-based tests. Additionally, you ignore up to 4 Strain while casting spells in armor.
