## Imperator Adin III Yazar (Deceased)

Imperator Adin III Yazar of Aqor died late summer of 35 Broken. He was 81. Adin III's reign over Yewdar's largest and most populous nation was not only the oldest in the nation's history but also its longest serving. Only those human Aqori themselves now elderly can remember living under any other Imperator. Over the course of his reign he was served by four Chancellors of the Imperium, a total of sixty-two individual members of the Shrouded Council, and two Ediqtors of the Faith.
