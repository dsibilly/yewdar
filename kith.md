# Kith

Yewdar is home to many kith of sentient beings. Some of them are native to the world, either seeded there by the gods or evolved from of indigenous fauna. Other kith are visitors or refugees from other planes who have made Yewdar their new home. Yet more are artificial life, created by powerful progenitors for purposes known and unknown.

There are a total of eight playable kith in the Yewdar campaign setting:

* [Humans](#human)
    * [Alsan](#alsan)
    * [Osan](#osan)
    * [Irsan](#irsan)
* [Elves](#elf)
* [Dwarves](#dwarf)
* [Gnomes](#gnome)
* [Halflings](#halfling)
* [Orcs](#orc)
* [Drakon](#drakon)
* [Div'](#div)
* [Talosan](#talosan)
* [Kith Reference Table](#kith-reference-table)

There are other kith, sentient and otherwise, but they are reserved for use by the Game Master (GM) populating the setting; consult with your GM before selecting a kith not detailed in this book.

---

## Human

Humans are the most numerous of the sentient species on Yewdar. They are relatively short-lived; humans rarely live longer than a century. Their fast lives make them a striving people. Unable to bide their brief time, they work hard and are always preoccupied with the immediate future. The older kith see them as short-sighted and impulsive, but there's no denying the success that their drive has earned them. Human kingdoms and enterprises are among the most culturally and economically dominant on the planet.

Humanity contains three major ethnic groups: the _Alsan_, _Osan_, and _Irsan_ peoples.

### Playing a Human

If you choose to play a human, modify your character as follows:

* Add +1 to your Fighting ability
* Pick one of the following ability focuses:
  * Dexterity \(Riding\)
  * Constitution \(Swimming\)
* Your speed is equal to 10 + Dexterity, minus your armor penalty
* You can speak and read the Common Tongue
* Choose one of the human ethnicities. Roll twice on the benefits table for that ethnicity for additional benefits. Roll 2d6 and add the result together. If you get the same result twice, re-roll until you get two unique results.

### Alsan

![](/assets/Seelah.jpg)

The Alsan peoples originally hail from the Aqor Imperium on the Chimak continent far to the west of Osenia. They "discovered" Osenia in antiquity, though it was already populated by Osan clans. Being relatively advanced compared to the native Osan, they quickly established a vast colony on Osenia to exploit the continent's lush natural resources. This vassal state later came to be known as the Nevrodt Empire, which the Osan eventuallly overthrew when they founded modern-day Kulturia. In the 1,200 years since the fall of Nevrodt, the remaining Alsan humans have integrated thoroughly into Kulturian society. They are a dark-brown skinned people with dark, straight hair, stout-framed with broad faces.

#### Alsan Names

**Female:** Meral, Niha, Yasmin, Hasret, Eren  
**Male:** Taylan, Ergan, Ateç, Fardin, Rami

### Osan

![](/assets/05677f86f52c689e01c072ee20ea69aa.jpeg)

The Osan peoples are a culturally Sannic-speaking group of humans native to the northwest region of the continent of Osenia. They are the most populous ethnicity of humans on Yewdar. "San," incidentally, is humanity's word for themselves in the common tongue Sannic. They were originally hardy folk accustomed to the extremes of their land. Centuries of subjugation by the Nevrodt Empire and forced "civilization" at the hands of their conquerors advanced their society considerably. By the time they overthrew their would-be masters the Osan were inheritors of industry and magic that were previously the exclusive realm of their clan priests. They are proud of their history as a people who threw off the yoke of oppression, and they value strength of body and mind. The Osan are now the most populous ethnicity of human on Osenia, with their home kingdom Kulturia remaining the largest and most powerful in the region. They are fair-skinned, with light-colored wavy hair. They tend to be tall, averaging from 1.7 meters to 2 meters.

### Irsan

![](/assets/1d543e5429b6fe1e33cb81ff61d91ca7.jpg)

The Irsan originated not from Osenia itself but from the nearby island sub-continent of Cheland to the southwest. They have a long history as a pastoral people, and their rolling plains replete with farms are considered the “breadbasket of Osenia.” Their culture values etiquette, conversation, honesty and hard work. They are hard-headed and practical, hardy and strong without being quarrelsome or unduly boisterous, brave without being melancholy or prideful. The Irsan are light olive-brown skinned, with dark and curled hair, and of middling height.

**Male:** Eduard, Karlo, Jodin, Kimo, Matti

## Elf

![](/assets/mutteran_lg.png)

The elves originally hail from a coplanar realm known as The Verdance, or Primal Wilds \(Eladari’el in Elvish.\) It is a wild and untamed replica of Yewdar that is at once separate from and connected to it. In the dim mists of antiquity, a population of proto-elves fled to Yewdar to escape a devastating civil war in Eladari’el. As they spent more time away from their home realm, they lost much of their attunement to the innate natural magic of their world. Their culture turned to the arcane forces they found in their new home, and their incredible longevity allowed them to attain a mastery unmatched by the other kith. Today’s elves live relatively short lives compared to their forebears, but it's not uncommon for an elf to see the turn of three centuries before they fade away.

Just over one elf generation ago, a great elven empire spanned the subcontinent of Ikaemo. The empire fell to an invasion of trolls whose durability and fecundity literally bred the elves out of their homeland. The survivors took to the sea on their elegant ships, staying close for mutual defense, looking for a new home. The last three centuries have seen the Eladar Fleet crisscrossing the seas of Yewdar at the command of the Prophetess Lalahni, whose vision of their next homeland Danari’el promises eventual rest and restoration of her people’s glory.

# Dwarf

![](/assets/d2023b81cbc2cba52fb3fd7cc2385c0e.jpg)

The dwarves are well-known throughout the world as skilled craftsmen and miners. Native to the continent of Osenia, they maintain a rigidly lawful caste-based society in their holds beneath the Grendian Mountains. The largest human cities are home to dwarven enclaves where the dwarves tend to keep to their own kind. They’re not xenophobic, per se, but they're slow to trust new acquaintances and can seem gruff and exclusionary to many of the other kith. Dwarves have long memories to match their multi-century lifespans: a dwarf is forever loyal and kind to friends, and a stalwart foe to those who have betrayed or wronged them.

Dwarves average between 1.2 and 1.5 meters tall, and tend to be stocky, solidly built people. They are known for their extravagant beards, which they grown long and wear plaited, braided, in tails, or any number of other styles.

### Dwarf Names

**Female:** Ailine, Dara, Kalin, Telka, Ulma

## Gnome

![](/assets/b94555f9bb2d5c682a29339e36d20d5c.jpg)

Like the elves, the gnomes of Yewdar are not native to this world; they originated in The Verdance. Short in stature and lithe in frame, they inhabited the underground realms of the Primal Wilds. They tended fungal orchards and herds of dire moles in their cavernous villages. They lived lives of curiosity and relative peace… until the formians came. The insectoids tore through the Underwilds like a storm of chitin and mandibles, snuffing out gnome settlements like so many candles. In desperation, a group of isolated refugees turned to their sorcerers, who devised a ritual to bring them to Yewdar and escape extinction. Formerly gregarious explorers and tinkerers, the gnomes on Yewdar are a stoic and grim. Sometimes, when they are absorbed in a task they enjoy, flickers of their original nature show through. The gnomes are torn between a desire to get to know their new world and neighbors better, and disdain for the relatively carefree lives the other kith live. They see peace as a time to prepare for the worst, and the other kith as naive and complacent.

Gnomes are small, ranging from 0.8 to 0.9 meters tall. Notably, gnomes have black eyes with no irises or discernible pupils.

### Gnome Names

**Female:** Libela, Ura, Sedea, Piti, Nerys  
**Male:** Jalb, Zohan, Edon, Antem, Lew  
**Surname:** Hetu, Orba, Inyo, Amil, Dratu

#### Gnomish Etiquette

Gnomes use their family names _before_ their given names. Lew of the Terul family is addressed as _Terul Lew_. Calling a gnome by their given name is a sign of close familiarity, and doing so without permission is considered disrespectful.

### Playing a Gnome

If you choose to play a gnome, modify your character as follows:

* Add +1 to your Dexterity ability
* Pick one of the following ability focuses:
  * Constitution \(Stamina\)
  * Dexterity \(Legerdemain\)

* Your Speed is equal to 8 + Dexterity, minus your armor penalty.
* You can speak and read Gnomish and the Common Tongue.
* Roll twice on the Gnome Benefits table for additional benefits. Roll 2d6 and add the result together. If you get the same result twice, re-roll until you get two unique results.

## Halfling

![](/assets/df9c6e4b1744c2cfd1f1a3e27b5168d1.jpg)

The halflings were a nomadic people in antiquity, and because of limited historical records their origins are unknown. Osenian halflings hail from the Reisian Principalities, a loose confederation of island nations. Most halflings are pastoral, tending to crops and small livestock, or running businesses that trade such things. About one in twenty halflings are affected \(or some might say afflicted\) by a powerful wanderlust that almost universally leads them into harm’s way. In these situations, the halfling knack for cunning, guile, and ingenuity often lets them see the next dawn… and with a story almost too outrageous to believe.

Halflings appear much like miniature humans, any vary just as much in skin tone and hair colors. They are quite diminutive, ranging from 0.9 to 1.3 meters tall.

### Halfling Names

**Female:** Bernice, Nikola, Doria, Rhoda, Lydia  
**Male:** Thadeus, Adrien, Khristos, Hector, Aeolus  
**Surnames:** Rokos, Sacca, Kostas, Siskos, Pippinpadilopsikopolous. Yes, really.

  * Communication \(Bargaining\)

* Roll twice on the Halfling Benefits table for additional benefits. Roll 2d6 and add the result together. If you get the same result twice, re-roll until you get two unique results.

## Orc

![](/assets/90e6b9371c16d892f168ff7c4717ba1a.jpg)

A primal, bestial people with a clan-based civilization, the orcs are native to the jungles of Hol Khozet in southern Osenia. They are an aggressive, proud, and tradition-bound people who value honor and combat; when they're not mounting raids into nearby villages and towns, they're taking part in bitter clan wars. The thirteen orc clans have been an in ever-shifting state of internecine war for centuries.

Many orcs live out their whole lives in Hol Khozet, but some leave their homeland in search of adventure, glory, or simply a reprieve from the endless clan wars. They can be found in many cities serving as bodyguards, mercenaries, mystics for hire, or independent adventurers.

Orcs are a large people, broad of beam and tall in stature. They range from 1.5 to over 2 meters tall. They have pointed, bat-like ears, flat noses, broad mouths, and an underbite that exposes their tusk-like incisors. Skin tones vary, with green being most common. Other colorations include brown, yellowish-tan, and in very rare cases, red.

### Orc Names

**Female:** Borba, Deze, Jefka, Res, Chaxa  
**Male:** Jorkey, Groc, Bolg, Taga, Vosk  
**Sept Names:** Sternlash, Grimward, Bouldersplitter, Cragmaul, Strongrunner

#### The Orcish Clans

There are thirteen clans of orcish civilization. The clans themselves are made up of numerous extended families that have pledged loyalty to a single chieftain. The families that comprise a clan are known as septs, and there can be dozens of septs in a clan, each with hundreds of warriors, shaman and children.

Every orc hails from a clan and sept, but most go informally by their given name and their sept/family name, e.g. Borba of the Cragmaul sept of the Shatterspear clan goes by Borba Cragmaul to non-orcs and in all but formal ceremonies among her people.

The orc clans are:

* Rockfang
* Ironcrusher
* Wolftooth
* Shatterspear
* Nightblood
* Boneaxe
* Deathrot
* Dreadfury
* Pitshade
* Redhand
* Ghostscream

## Drakon

![](/assets/Character_2da80f_5793915.jpg)

Draconic humanoids, the drakon are a long-lived result of arcane-engineered life. They were created by the dragons of old as shock troopers for the ancient Cthene Empire. After the Day of Broken Scales, when dragons disappeared from the world, the drakon were left leaderless and lost. Now few in number, they live on the fringes of humanoid society. They take odd jobs or wander nomadically in small bands, trying to eke out a living in a world that disdains them. More than a few drakon have settled in the Cthene Wastes, the ruined remnants of their original home. There they search out clues of their progenitors' mysterious disappearance.

### Drakon Names

**Female:** Malrim, Thergrod, Zengil, Suvyre, Lorazys

You wield a breath weapon like your dragon ancestors.

**Novice: **You gain the following attack:  
Choose a target within 10 yards. Make a successful Accuracy attack against that target to deal 1d6+2 penetrating damage to them. You may use this attack a number of times per day equal to your Constitution. The nature of your breath weapon is based on the draconic bloodline that is most dominant in your heritage.

**Journeyman:** Your draconic breath now deals 2d6+2 penetrating damage.

**Master:** Your draconic breath attack widens to an area of effect 10 yards long and three yards wide. Anyone caught in the blast takes 2d6+2 penetrating damage. Targets that succeed on an opposed Dexterity \(Acrobatics\) test against your attack roll ignore all the damage.

## Div'

The Div' are the daemon-touched humanoids of the continent of Chimak. Long ago, when the first humans were being made, there was an incident. The daemons of Entropius were able to corrupt the nascent beings' physical forms, but they hadn't been provided with souls yet. Dynu, god of valor and the progenitor of humans, saw what had become of his creations and decided to wipe the slate clean and begin anew. His sister Vor, goddess of mercy, took pity upon the discarded mortals and took them as her own. Vor's love purged their forms of any lingering corruption, but left their bodies as they were: color-tinged, with glowing eyes, pointed fangs, and curved horns. As cousins to humanity, they could breed with humans, but any offspring would be new Div'.

The Div' are native to the northern reaches of the Chimak continent, now part of the continent-spanning Aqori Imperium. There are communities in the deserts, mountains, and plains. Div' are, like most folk, broadly ecumenical, but tend to show special preference for the worship of Vor (mercy), Meno (knowledge), and Mym (luck).

Reflecting their preferences in deities, Div' society is also highly matriarchal. Div' are fully integrated citizens of the Imperium, with the right to own property and establish Houses Minor if they have the resources and political support to do so. They are rare outside Chimak, though common enough in the metropolises like Apex City, Hinshire, and Lucara. The Div' have a closer connection to chaotic energies due to their entropic heritage. They can sense the presence of daemons, and some scions can channel entropy to heal themselves or even adjust the outcome of fateful events.

## Talosan

![](/assets/ce82fca3559e554bc3ad55b04ea751de.jpg)

The Talosan are are sentient machines created by arcanists seeking to make arcane-engineered life. Most Talosan were originally designed as weapons of war by Laurentian mages in their rebellion against Kulturia. The machines awoke to sentience through the hidden efforts of their original designer, Professor Bramwell Payne. There are approximately 50,000 Talosan in existence, integrated into humanoid society to various degrees. Some continue to serve as soldiers, others as tradesmen. Non-Talosan tend to view them with a mix of curiosity and prejudice. In particular, the poor of Laurentia see them as a threat to their livelihoods. More than a few Talosan have been driven to mercenary work, seeking a vocation where merit and performance are rewarded and one may obtain dignity without the pre-approval of fearful organic kith.

### Talosan Names

**Female:** Jewel-19, Virtue-25, Mya-49, Kaja-914, Yasmin-33  
**Male:** Bart-723, Cason-2, Malik-68, Jerry-4, Kristoph-154

Talosan typically have no surnames, but some choose to take one.

### Playing a Talosan

If you choose to play a Talosan, modify your character as follows:

* Add +1 to your Strength ability
* You gain the Ability Focus: Constitution \(Stamina\)
* Your Speed is equal to 10 + Dexterity, minus your armor penalty.
* You gain the Kith Talent: Talos Forged
* Roll twice on the Talosan Benefits table for additional benefits. Roll 2d6 and add the result together. If you get the same result twice, re-roll until you get two unique results.

#### Kith Talent: Talos Forged

Classes: Any  
Kith: Talosan

You are a living construct.

**Novice:** You do not need to eat, drink or breathe. You never succumb to the effects of starvation, thirst, suffocation, poison or disease. All other conditions affect you normally. You do not need sleep; instead you enter a state of inactivity for 4 hours to gain the effects of a night's rest. While in this state, you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal. When reduced to zero hit points, instead of dying as per _Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook_, pp. 35, you remain able to take one Minor Action per round. If you take further damage equal to your Constitution, you cease to function.

**Journeyman:** You have the Forged Resurgence power. You may spend a Minor Action to recover 1d6 + Constitution hit points. You may use this power a number of times per day equal to your Constitution.

**Master:** You may enhance your outer plating to act as armor. In exchange for an equivalent armor penalty, you may gain up to 3 points of Armor Rating. This plating stacks with normal armor, but does not contribute to armor strain when casting spells.
