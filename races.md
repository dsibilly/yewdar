# Races

Yewdar is home to many races of sentient beings. Some of them are native to the world, seeded there by the gods or evolved forms of indigenous fauna. Other races are visitors or refugees from other planes who have made Yewdar their new home. Yet more are artificial life, created by powerful progenitors for purposes known and unknown.

There are a total of eight playable races in the Yewdar campaign setting:

* [Humans](#human)
  * Alsan
  * Osan
  * Irsan
* [Elves](#elf)
* Dwarves
* Gnomes
* Halflings
* Orcs
* Drakon
* Talosan

There are other races, sentient and otherwise, but are reserved for use by Game Masters populating the setting; consult with your Game Master before selecting a race not detailed in this book.

## Human

Humans are the most numerous of the sentient species on Yewdar. They are relatively short-lived, with lifetimes over a century being exceedingly rare. Their fast lives make them a striving people. Unable to bide their brief time, they work hard and are always preoccupied with the immediate future. The older races see them as short-sighted and impulsive, but there is no denying the success that their drive has earned. Human kingdoms and enterprises are among the most culturally and economically dominant on the planet.

Humanity contains three major ethnic groups: the _Alsan_, _Osan_, and \_Irsan \_peoples.

### Playing a Human

If you choose to play a human, modify your character as follows:

* Add +1 to your Fighting ability
* Pick one of the following ability focuses:
  * Dexterity \(Riding\)
  * Constitution \(Swimming\)
* Your speed is equal to 10 + Dexterity, minus your armor penalty
* You can speak and read the Common Tongue
* Choose one of the human ethnicities. Roll twice on the benefits table for that ethnicity for additional benefits. Roll 2d6 and add the result together. If you get the same result twice, re-roll until you get two unique results.

### Alsan

The Alsan peoples originally hail from the Aqor Imperium on the Chimak contintent far to the west of Osenia. They "discovered" Osenia in antiquity, though it was already populated by Osan clans. Being relatively advanced compared to the native Osan, they quickly established a vast colony on Osenia to exploit the continent's lush natural resources. This vassal state later came to be known as the Nevrodt Empire, which the Osan eventuallly overthrew when they founded modern-day Kulturia. In the 1,200 years since the fall of Nevrodt, the remaining Alsan humans have integrated thoroughly into Kulturian society. They are a dark brown skinned people with dark, straight hair, stout-framed with broad faces.

### Osan

The indigenous humans of the Osenia continent, the Osan peoples were originally hardy folk accustomed to the extremes of their land. Centuries of subjugation by the Nevrodt Empire and forced "civilization" at the hands of their conquerors advanced their society considerably, and by the time they overthrew their would-be masters the Osan were inheritors of industry and magic that were heretofore the exclusive realm of their clan priests. They are proud of their history as a people who threw off the yoke of oppression, and they value strength of body and mind. The Osan are now the most populous ethnicity of human on Osenia, with their home kingdom Kulturia remaining the largest and most powerful in the region. They are fair-skinned, with light-colored wavy hair. They tend to be tall, with women averaging 1.7 meters and heights of 2 meters not uncommon among males.

### Irsan

The Irsan originated not from Osenia itself but from the nearby island sub-continent of Cheland to the southwest. They have a long history as a pastoral people, and their rolling plains replete with farms are considered the “breadbasket of Osenia.” Their culture values etiquette, conversation, honesty and hard work. They are hard-headed and practical, hardy and strong without being quarrelsome or unduly boisterous, brave without being melancholy or prideful.

## Elf

The Elves originally hail from a coplanar realm known as The Verdance, or Primal Wilds \(Eladari’el in Elvish.\) It is a wild and untamed replica of Yewdar that is at once separate from and connected to it. In the dim mists of antiquity, a population of proto-elves fled to Yewdar to escape a devastating civil war in Eladari’el. As they spent more time away from their home realm, they lost much of their attunement to the innate natural magic of the world. Their culture turned to the arcane forces they found in their new home, and their incredible longevity allowed them to attain a mastery unmatched by the other races. Today’s elves live relatively short lives compared to their forebears, but it is not uncommon for an elf to see the turn of three centuries before they fade away.

Just over one elf generation ago, a great elven empire spanned the subcontinentt of Ikaemo. The empire fell to an invasion of trolls whose durability and fecundity literally bred the elves out of their homeland. The survivors took to the sea on their elegant ships, staying close for mutual defense, looking for a new home. The last three centuries have seen the Eladar Fleet criss-crossing the seas of Yewdar at the command of the Prophetess Lalahni, whose vision of the next homeland Danari’el promises eventual rest and restoration of her people’s glory.

# Dwarf

The dwarves are well-known throughout the world as skilled craftsmen and miners. Native to the continent of Osenia, they maintain a rigidly lawful caste-based society in their holds beneath the Grendian Mountains. The largest human cities are home to dwarven enclaves where they tend to keep to their own kind. They’re not xenophobic, per se, but they are slow to trust new acquaintances and can seem gruff and exclusionary to many of the other races. Dwarves have long memories to match their multi-century lifespans: a dwarf is forever loyal and kind to friends, and a stalwart foe to those who have betrayed or wronged them.

Dwarves average between 1.2 and 1.5 meters tall, and tend to be stocky, solidly built people. They are known for their extravagant beards, which they grown long and wear plaited, braided, in tails, or any number of other styles.

**Female:** Ailine, Dara, Kalin, Telka, Ulma
