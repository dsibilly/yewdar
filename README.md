## Welcome to Yewdar

_A mercenary band escorts archaeologists deep into the deserts of Cthene. They seek answers to the centuries old question: what became of the dragons of old, and where did they go?_

_A young artificer experiments with imbuing a sword with arcanathyst, a miraculous mineral found in the merchant mines of Apex City. With the application of magical power, the sword can be made light as a feather, or heavy as a maul…_

_A sky pirate captain lies in wait in the clouds over the Rockridge mountains. The pickings have been slim for days; airship patrols have kept his crew from taking any booty. Rumor has it, though, that a slow skyliner full of well-heeled fatcats is headed this way tonight… and the captain means to collect._

_An elf returns to the Eladar Fleet a hero. 25 years ago he left his family and friends and went ashore among the jandar'ii \(round ears\) to begin his pelegrín, or pilgrimage. He could not return without something of value to his ship: equipment, knowledge, power. Years spent exploring and adventuring with the land-bound races afforded him all three, and by the grace of the gods they might one day find Danari'el, their promised land._

_A young priestess of Meno, Goddess of Knowledge, is concerned. Across the countryside, people have been having the same nightmares: of gaping maws and grasping tendrils, hooks and teeth and eyes and blood. As she seeks answers in the depths of her library temple, her lone acolyte delivers grave news. Someone in the village died tonight, strangled by something longer than the arms of any humanoid…_

What is Yewdar?

Yewdar is a homebrew campaign setting for Green Ronin's Fantasy AGE system. If borrows inspiration from diverse sources: BioWare's Mass Effect series, Keith Baker's Eberron, Lovecraftian horro, and Weis & Hickman's Dragonlance setting.

The world of Yewdar is highly magical, so much so that magic has filled the civilization niche that science has in our real world. Industrial progress via magical study and application has been explosive: airships ply the skies, street lamps glow with eldrich power, artificers create mass producible marvels that were the realm of true artifacts mere centuries past.

Much of this progress is drive by an enigmatic mineral known as arcanathyst. Subjected to magic, is has diverse and useful effects that can be shared with any material it is bonded with. It has become the wondroud catalyst of civilization... but while some cities and nations are rich in arcanathyst, others are not, and the boon of progress is not shared equally.

## **Tone and Attitude**

This world combines traditional medieval fantasy and swashbuckling action plus dark adventure. There are no "black and white" absolutes; in fact, the very concept of alignments are not used at all. Nothing is ever quite what it seems: the fantasy stereotypes are blurred, and it's possible to encounter a nefarious silver Drakon or an altruistic vampire.

## **A World of High Magic**

The setting presupposes a world that developed not through scientific advancement but by the mastery of arcane magic. This allows for conveniences and breakthroughs unimaginable in an otherwise medieval setting. The rare mineral _arcanathyst_ makes airships and rail travel possible. A working class of minor mages uses spells to provide energy and other necessities to towns and cities. Advances in magical item creation enables wonders from self-propelled farming equipment to sentient, free-willed constructs.

## **A World of Adventure**

From the steaming jungles of Hol Khozet to the towering spires of Apex City, to the blasted badlands of the Cthene Wastes, Yewdar is a world of action and adventure. Adventures can and _should_ draw heroes from on exotic locale to another across nations, continents, and the entire world. Via magical transportation, heroes can reach a wider range of environments over the course of an adventure, bringing them into contact with a wide variety of monsters and challenges.

## **New Races**

Yewdar's unique setting takes the core player races in the _Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook_ and changes the assumptions of culture, race and ethnicity to provide [all-new options for players to choose from](/races.md). Additionally, it adds new races such as the Drakon and Talosan. Drakon are magically-created draconic humanoids, created by the long-lost dragons. They possess great strength and resilience, but not the longevity of their progenitors. Talosan are sentient constructs, built by contemporary arcanists as weapons of war and disposable labor. They developed free well and now seek to improve their position in the world.
