## Welcome to Yewdar

_A mercenary band escorts archaeologists deep into the deserts of Cthene. They seek answers to the centuries-old question: what became of the dragons of old, and where did they go?_

_A young artificer experiments with imbuing a sword with arcanathyst, a miraculous mineral found in the merchant mines of Apex City. With the application of magical power, the sword can be made light as a feather, or heavy as a maul…_

_A sky pirate captain lies in wait in the clouds over the Rockridge Mountains. The pickings have been slim for days; airship patrols have kept his crew from taking any booty. Rumor has it, though, that a slow skyliner full of well-heeled fatcats is headed this way tonight… and the captain means to collect._

_An elf returns to the Eladar Fleet a hero. Twenty-five years ago, he left his family and friends and went ashore among the jandar'ii \(round ears\) to begin his pelegrín, his pilgrimage. He could not return without something of value to his ship: equipment, knowledge, power. Years spent exploring and adventuring with the land-bound kith afforded him all three, and by the grace of the gods, he might help his people to one day find Danari'el, their promised land._

_A young priestess of Meno, Goddess of Knowledge, is concerned. Across the countryside, people have been having the same nightmares: of gaping maws and grasping tendrils, hooks and teeth and eyes and blood. As she seeks answers in the depths of her library temple, her lone acolyte delivers grave news. Someone in the village died tonight, strangled by something longer than the arms of any humanoid…_

Yewdar is a homebrew campaign setting for Green Ronin's Fantasy AGE system. It borrows inspiration from diverse sources: BioWare's _Mass Effect_ series, Keith Baker's _Eberron_, Lovecraftian horror, and Weis & Hickman's _Dragonlance_.

The world of Yewdar is highly magical, so much so that magic fills the same role as science in the real world. Industrial progress via magical study and application has been explosive: airships ply the skies, street lamps glow with eldritch power, and artificers create mass-producible marvels that were the realm of true artifacts mere centuries past.

Much of this progress is driven by an enigmatic mineral known as arcanathyst. Subjected to magic, it has diverse and useful effects that can be shared with any material it is bonded with. It has become the wondrous catalyst of civilization... but while some cities and nations are rich in arcanathyst, others are not, and the boon of progress is not shared equally.

## What Is An RPG?

If *Yewdar* is your introduction to the world of fantasy roleplaying games (RPGs for short), then welcome! You might be rightly wondering, "What is all this?"
A roleplaying game thrusts you and a group of friends into the roles of fictional characters. As players, you portray your character as well as decide what they do. One player in the group serves as the Game Master (GM) for short. The Game Master acts as the narrator of the story and the referee who enforces some rules. The GM sets the scene and describes what happens to and around your characters. You, along with the other players, decide what your characters do in response. The GM describes the outcome of your actions, and the cycle continues as you collectively spin a unique tale of adventure.
The characters portrayed by players are called Player Characters, or PCs. Players are responsible for playing their characters and working together to make sure everyone has a good time. Sometimes characters come into conflict, arguing over what to do, but the *players* should do everything they can to get alone. It's a bit like acting: the hero and the villain of a story may hate each other, but hopefully the actors who play as them don't! Be considerate, don't boss each other around, and you'll have fun.

## Getting Started

Here's what you'll need to get a *Yewdar* game underway:

- **Players**: Players portray the main characters (PCs) of the game's story. Each player should ready the players' section of this document for the rules you need to know. Don't worry if you don't understand all of the rules - it's a lot more fun to learn some parts of the game by *doing* instead of by reading.
- **Game Master**: One of the players at the table must take on the role of the Game Master, or GM. They portray the game's villains, allies, and other characters - everyone who isn't portrayed by the player. They set up storylines, events, and challenges for the PCs. Because of this, they need to have a firm grasp of the rules. They must be impartial - no player can be their favorite - but they also need to look out for anyone who seems to be having less fun or is somehow being left behind. If you're the GM, you will likely make like difficult for the *characters*, but your true goal is to help the *players* enjoy themselves. Listen to what your players want, and help them out when they're not sure how to use the rules.
- **Dice**: *Yewdar* uses six-sided dice, the basic cubes that you're probably familiar with from board games or casino table games. You need at least three to do most things. One die should be a different color or style (e.g. dots instead of numerals) that sets it apart from the others. This different die will act as your Stunt Die (which is used as a core part of the rules - read on for more.) If you use a dice-rolling app, make sure there's a way to separate one die from the rest.
- **Character Sheets, Paper, and Pencils**: Copy the character sheets provided in this document or others of your own design to record your character's statistics. Make sure you keep pencils and plenty of blank paper on-hand for notes, impromptu maps, etc. Tablets, phones and laptops can serve this purpose as well, but you'll often be called upon to share the notes you've made and passing a computing device around isn't as easy a a slip of paper!
- **Someplace to Play**: While the traditional game setup seats everyone at a table with plenty of snacks and beverages, you can play *Yewdar* both in-person and online via chat programs, online forums, and virtual tabletop services.

### The Adventure Game Engine

*Yewdar* is powered by the Adventure Game Engine System, called AGE for short. It was originally designed for the *Dragon Age RPG* by Green Ronin Publishing. It was later published as a pair of stand-alone rules systems called *Fantasy AGE* and *Modern AGE*. While these games are not identical to *Yewdar*, they share the same DNA, and *Yewdar* borrows gameplay mechanics heavily from both. If you are familiar with any AGE System game, it should be easy to pick up another. If you enjoy your time playing *Yewdar* with the AGE System, you may want to explore the original systems from Green Ronin.

## **Tone and Attitude**

Yewdar combines traditional medieval fantasy and swashbuckling action plus dark adventure. There are no "black and white" absolutes; in fact, the very concept of alignments do not exist in Yewdar. Nothing is ever quite what it seems: the fantasy stereotypes are blurred, and it's possible to encounter a nefarious valorwyrm Drakon or an altruistic vampire.

## **A World of High Magic**

This setting presupposes a world that developed not through scientific advancement but by the mastery of arcane magic. This allows for conveniences and breakthroughs unimaginable in an otherwise medieval setting. The rare mineral _arcanathyst_ makes airships and rail travel possible. A working class of minor mages uses spells to provide energy and other necessities to towns and cities. Advances in magical item creation enables wonders from self-propelled farming equipment to sentient, free-willed constructs.

## **A World of Adventure**

From the steaming jungles of Hol Khozet to the towering spires of [Apex City](/apex-city.md), to the blasted badlands of the Cthene Wastes, Yewdar is a world of action and adventure. Adventures can and _should_ draw heroes from one exotic locale to another across nations and continents. Via magical transportation, heroes can reach a wider range of environments over the course of an adventure, bringing them into contact with a wide variety of monsters and challenges.

## **A Note on "Race"**

First, a note about the term _race_. _Race_ is typically used to denote a collection of physical characteristics within the same species. It is clear that this definition is a poor choice for different fantastical species like those found in RPGs. For this reason, the term _race_ has been replaced with the term _kith_ unless referring to the _Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook_.

Yewdar's setting takes the core player races in the _Fantasy AGE Basic Rulebook_ and changes the assumptions of culture, race, and ethnicity to provide [all-new options for players to choose from](/kith.md). Additionally, it adds new kith such as the Drakon and Talosan. Drakon are draconic humanoids created through magical means by the long-lost dragons. They possess great strength and resilience, but not the longevity of their progenitors. Talosan are sentient constructs, built by contemporary arcanists as weapons of war and disposable labor. They developed free will and now seek to improve their position in the world.
